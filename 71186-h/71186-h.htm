<h3 class='c013'>I<br> THE VOYAGE OF VESPUCCI PAST THE MOUTHS OF THE MISSISSIPPI</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>According to the historical researches set forth in this first paper
of a series on the discoveries and explorations of the Mississippi
in various portions of its course, the river appears to
have been earliest discovered and mapped at its mouth in a voyage of
Pinzon and Solis, with Amerigo Vespucci as astronomer and cartographer,
probably in March or April, 1498, less than six years from the first landfall
of Columbus. Twenty-one years then passed before the Mississippi
was next seen in the voyage of Pineda, in 1519, being reached by ascending
a bayou from Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas. In 1528 one of
the mouths of the Mississippi was seen in the forlorn last voyage of
Narvaez; and in 1541 the river was crossed far above its mouth, by the
ambitious but ill-fated expedition of De Soto, and after his death it was
descended by the survivors in boats to the Gulf. Four times within a
period of forty-three years, the Spaniards reached by sea and by land
the lower part of the Mississippi. They sought gold or silver in vain,
and the extreme disasters of the last two expeditions caused them to
abandon their purpose of planting colonies and making this region
a part of New Spain. The entire river, excepting its sources, was to be
explored and owned by others, but much later, for acquiring wealth by
commerce, and for extending the dominion of France.</p>

<p class='c015'>More than a hundred years after De Soto, the Mississippi was
re-discovered by Europeans, this time in its upper course, when Groseilliers
and Radisson in 1655, with many Indian canoes, ascended it from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>near the Wisconsin river to Prairie Island, if I have rightly understood
the narrative of Radisson; and they crossed it higher, at or near the site
of Minneapolis, in 1660, when they went to visit the Prairie Sioux at the
farthest limit of their second western expedition.</p>

<p class='c015'>Halfway in time between De Soto and these men, a Spanish expedition
under Oñate, coming from New Mexico in 1601, probably reached
the Mississippi near the mouth of the Arkansas river; but we have only
scanty records of this exploration, which some have ascribed to the year
1662, following a fictitious narrative that would make Peñalosa the
leader.</p>

<p class='c015'>Eighteen years after Groseilliers and Radisson’s first trip, Joliet
and Marquette navigated the Mississippi for a long distance southward
from the Wisconsin river, to the Arkansas; and again, after seven years
more, in 1680, it was navigated between the Illinois and Rum rivers by
Hennepin, and also, above the Wisconsin, by Du Luth. In 1682 La
Salle led an expedition from the Illinois to the mouth of the Mississippi,
and there proclaimed its vast drainage area to be the property of France.
A few years later, about 1685–90, Le Sueur and his relative by marriage,
Charleville, canoed from Lake Pepin far upward beyond the Falls of St.
Anthony, probably to Sandy Lake; and in the last year of the seventeenth
century, just forty-five years after Groseilliers superintended corn-raising
by the Hurons on Prairie Island, Le Sueur and a large mining party
navigated the whole extent of the Mississippi from near its mouth to the
Minnesota river, and then advanced up that stream to the Blue Earth
river.</p>

<p class='c015'>Without seeking or suggestion by himself, the name of Amerigo
Vespucci (also commonly known, in Latin, as Americus Vespucius) was
bestowed upon the New World, of which, next after Columbus, he was
the most notable discoverer in the sense of bringing to the knowledge of
Europe what he saw in four voyages. Though not in command of these
expeditions, Vespucci was a skilled geographer, and his services as
astronomer and pilot were required to determine and chart their courses,
with the newly discovered lands. His letters of description, written to
friends without expectation of publication, were printed and proved to
be of such popular interest that they passed through many editions and
translations, leading to the adoption of the name America, after his
death, on maps and globes. It was at first applied to Brazil, which Vespucci
coasted on his second, third, and fourth voyages, and was later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>extended to both North and South America. In his first voyage, with
four vessels, leaving Spain May 10, 1497, and returning October 15,
1498, he appears to have sailed along the shores of Honduras, Yucatan,
the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and our southeastern seaboard north to
Pamlico Sound.</p>

<p class='c015'>Between Vespucci and Columbus a cordial and mutual friendship
existed, and the Florentine pilot had no wish nor thought of taking away
from the Genoese admiral any part of the honor and gratitude due to
him. Both sailed in the service of Spain, but Vespucci also made two
voyages for Portugal. It was a Latin book by a German geographer,
Waldseemüller, published in the little college town of St. Dié, in a valley
of the Vosges mountains in northeastern France, April 25, 1507, which
first proposed the name America for the region described by Vespucci
south of the equator. There was at that time no intention to include
under it the countries farther north discovered and explored by Columbus,
Cabot, and other navigators. Winsor and Fiske have traced very
instructively the growth of European knowledge of the New World,
whereby it was finally learned that all the coasts explored from Labrador
to the strait of Magellan are connected parts of one vast continent, on
which Mercator bestowed the single name America in 1541, twenty-nine
years after Vespucci’s death.</p>

<p class='c015'>Succeeding generations long imputed blame to Vespucci for this
supplanting of Columbus in the name of the new continent; but either
would have scorned to wrong the other, or to falsify or exaggerate intentionally
in the narrations of their voyages. The personal honor of Vespucci
has been vindicated by the researches of Alexander Humboldt and
the Brazilian historian, Varnhagen; and the latter, in 1865 and 1869,
well ascertained that Vespucci’s first voyage, made in 1497–98, concerning
which much doubt and misunderstanding remained because of the lack
of many details in the narration, was the source of the first mapping of
Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico, and Florida. In Vespucci’s chart of that
very early date the Mississippi river was unmistakably delineated, with a
three-mouthed delta projecting into the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c015'>Varnhagen’s luminous researches, published between thirty and forty
years ago, were brought more fully to the attention of readers of our
English language by Hubert Howe Bancroft in 1883 (<cite>Central America</cite>,
vol. I, pp. 99–107), and especially by John Fiske’s work, <cite>The Discovery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of America</cite>, published in 1892. No official reports nor chart of Vespucci’s
first voyage, which was probably under the commandership of Pinzon
and Solis, are preserved; but two very early maps, evidently drafted
in part from the chart of that expedition, still exist, and were essentially
reproduced ten years ago by Harrisse, Winsor, and Fiske, in their elaborate
discussions of the Columbian and later discoveries.</p>

<p class='c015'>One of these two maps was drafted in 1502 by some unknown
Portuguese cartographer for Alberto Cantino, an Italian envoy at Lisbon,
and hence is called the Cantino map. It delineated crudely the
southeastern coast of the United States from the “Rio de los Palmas”
(River of Palms)—thought by Fiske to be the Apalachicola river—eastward
around Florida and onward north to Pamlico Sound, according to
my identification. The coast bears many names of rivers, capes, etc.;
and the end of the Florida peninsula is called “C. do fim do Abrill”
(Cape of the end of April), whence it is inferred that the expedition in
which Vespucci sailed on his first voyage, whose chart supplied this part
of the Cantino map, passed through the strait separating Florida from
Cuba at the end of April, 1498. The west edge of this map is at its
River of Palms, so that it fails to give any information of the part of
the Gulf of Mexico farther west.</p>

<p class='c015'>Comparing the Cantino map with our southeastern coast line, to
determine how far Vespucci saw it, I recognize, in their order from south
to north, Jupiter Inlet or Indian River Inlet, Cape Canaveral, the St.
John’s river (or, probably better, Cumberland Sound and St. Mary’s
river, or St. Andrew’s Sound, or the Altamaha), then Warsaw and
Tybee capes and the Savannah river, Cape Romain, the Santee river,
Winyah Bay and the Pedee river, Cape Fear, New River Inlet, Cape
Lookout, the Neuse and Pamlico rivers, and Long Shoal Point (or Sandy
or Stumpy Point), extending into the north part of Pamlico Sound. The
coast is represented as wholly trending to the north, instead of its curvature
to the northeast. Entering Pamlico Sound by Ocracoke Inlet (or
whatever passage existed near there four hundred years ago), the ships
were probably repaired for the homeward voyage at some very favorable
harbor among the many along the exceedingly irregular landward side
of this sound, or at some distance up either of its large tributary rivers.
The chart failed to note the long beach ridge of sand which forms Cape
Hatteras and separates the sound (“mar vaano”) from the ocean.</p>

<p class='c015'>Waldseemüller, the geographer at St. Dié, drafted the second of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>these maps, at some date probably after 1504 and certainly not later than
1508. It was published at Strasburg in an edition of Ptolemy in 1513,
and was entitled “Tabula Terre Nove.” From its reference to a
“former Admiral,” probably Columbus, it has been often called “the
Admiral’s map.” This bears testimony that the expedition described by
Vespucci as his first voyage passed the Mississippi and charted its
mouths; for west of the Atlantic coast and Florida, where the shores and
names are closely like the Cantino map, Waldseemüller gave a distorted
outline of the Gulf of Mexico, with a large river emptying into it by
three mouths, pushing its delta far into the gulf, in which respect the
Mississippi surpasses any other river, this being indeed the most remarkable
feature of its embouchure. I cannot doubt, therefore, that Vespucci
sailed past the Mississippi delta early in the year 1498, surveying the
mouths of the river from the masthead, or very likely entering the river
and spending some time there.</p>

<p class='c015'>The original “Letter of Amerigo Vespucci upon the Isles newly
found in his Four Voyages” was published in facsimile pages, with English
translation, under the editorship of George Young, in Philadelphia
in 1893, forming a book entitled “The Columbus Memorial,” its earlier
half being occupied by facsimiles, translations, and notes of letters by
Columbus. Only a very scanty statement was given by Vespucci concerning
the voyage from some port on the west coast of the Gulf of
Mexico, probably that of Tampico, at the mouth of the Panuco river, to
“a harbour the best in the world,” which appears to have been on Pamlico
Sound or river, whence, after repairing their vessels, the expedition
returned to Spain. Vespucci wrote of the voyage between these ports:
“We navigated along the coast, always in sight of land, until we had run
870 leagues of it, still going in the direction of the maestrale [northwest],
making in our course many halts, and holding intercourse with
many peoples; and in several places we obtained gold by barter, but not
much in quantity, for we had done enough in discovering the land and
learning that they had gold.”</p>

<p class='c015'>According to Varnhagen and Fiske, the direction of their sailing,
noted as northwestward, referred only to the first start from the port in
Mexico, after which they continued along the irregular coast line 870
leagues. It seems to me also noteworthy that they came to this Mexican
port by a northwestward course, and so perhaps Vespucci meant only that
they went directly onward along the coast, which in that part curves very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>gradually to a nearly north course. From his statements of time, with
the date indicated by the maps for passing the south end of Florida, it
is probable that the expedition was at the Mississippi river late in March
or early in April, 1498. Our history of this river, as known to
Europeans, thus extends through four centuries.</p>

<p class='c015'>As my study of the limit of this voyage of Vespucci on the coast
of the United States, regarded thus to be at Pamlico Sound, differs somewhat
from the conclusions of either Varnhagen or Fiske, it should be
remarked further that the Pamlico region had a considerable Indian
population, with many little villages, when it was described ninety years
later by Thomas Hariot (or Harriott), a member of the unfortunate
colony founded there in 1585 on Roanoke island, under the patronage of
Sir Walter Raleigh. The Indians at first were very friendly to these
colonists, as their forbears had been (if my identification of the locality is
true) to Vespucci and his companions. The translation of this part of
Vespucci’s narrative, given by Young, is as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>“We found an immense number of people, who received us with
much friendliness&#160;... the land’s people gave us very great assistance,
and continually furnished us with their victuals, so that in this port we
tasted very little of our own, which suited our game well, for the stock
of provisions which we had for our return passage was little and of sorry
kind. Where [<em>i. e.</em> there] we remained 37 days, and went many times to
their villages, where they paid us the greatest honour: and [now] desiring
to depart upon our voyage, they made complaint to us how at certain
times of the year there came from over the sea to this their land, a race
of people very cruel, and enemies of theirs, and by means of treachery or
of violence slew many of them, and ate them; and some they made
captives, and carried them away to their houses or country; and
how they could scarcely contrive to defend themselves from them, making
signs to us that [those] were an island people and lived out in the sea
about a hundred leagues away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And so piteously did they tell us this that we believed them, and
promised to avenge them of so much wrong, and they remained overjoyed
herewith; and many of them offered to come along with us, but we
did not wish to take them for many reasons, save that we took seven of
them on condition that they should come [<em>i. e.</em> return home] afterwards
in canoes, because we did not desire to be obliged to take them back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>their country: and they were contented, and so we departed from those
people, leaving them very friendly towards us: and having repaired our
ships, and sailing for seven days out to sea between northeast and east,
at the end of the seven days we came upon the islands, which were many,
some [of them] inhabited, and others deserted: and we anchored at one
of them, where we saw a numerous people who call it Iti: and having
manned our boats with strong crews, and [taken] three guns in each, we
made for land, where we found [assembled] about 400 men and women,
and all naked like the former [peoples].”</p>

<p class='c015'>Hard fighting ensued. Many of the natives of the islands were
killed, and at last the Spaniards put them to flight and returned to their
ships. The next day the natives came again to renew the contest, for
which the Spaniards landed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“After a long battle,” wrote Vespucci, describing this second day,
“[in which] many of them [were] slain, we put them [again] to flight,
and pursued them to a village, having made about 250 of them prisoners;
and we burnt the village, and returned to our ships with victory and 250
prisoners, leaving many of them dead and wounded; and of ours there
were no more than one killed, and 22 wounded, who all escaped [<em>i. e.</em>
recovered], God be thanked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We arranged our departure, and the seven men, of whom five
were wounded, took an island canoe, and with seven prisoners that we
gave them,—four women and three men,—returned to their [own]
country full of gladness, wondering at our strength: and we thereupon
made sail for Spain, with 222 captive slaves, and reached the port of
Cadiz on the 15 day of October, 1498, where we were well received and
sold our slaves.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Varnhagen, in his discussion of Vespucci’s voyages, presented arguments
to show that the Bermudas were the group of islands thus occupied
by a warlike and cannibal people, whom he supposed to have been soon
afterwards exterminated by slavers, before the discovery of these islands
by Bermudez about the year 1522, when they were uninhabited. Bancroft
and Fiske inclined to the same view. It seems to me more probable,
however, that the Bermudas, distant fully six hundred miles from
any other land, had never been peopled until they were found by
Europeans. The extreme isolation and comparatively small extent of
the Bermuda group, far out in the sea, would make it practically impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>for the savages, with any means of navigation that they possessed,
to pass back and forth in frequent war expeditions.</p>

<p class='c015'>Instead, I believe that the islands visited by Vespucci on the return
voyage were the northern part of the Bahama group. Without going
so far from the coast and its inlets as to incur much danger of storms, or
to completely lose the course and the reckoning in cloudy weather, canoe
expeditions from the Bahamas could come frequently, as the narrative
says, to attack the Indians in the region of Pamlico Sound. These
Indians, too, sometimes pursuing their enemies homeward, might learn
the situation of their islands, and would thus be able to pilot the way for
Vespucci’s ships. According to this view, they sailed south from Pamlico
Sound to the Bahamas. The direction of east-northeast, given in the
narrative, must be a mistake, being applicable instead for the course taken
from the Bahamas to Spain. The larger islands of this very extensive
group had many inhabitants when discovered by Columbus; but they were
afterward wholly depopulated by the unspeakable cruelties of slave-traders.</p>

<p class='c015'>The journal and letters of Columbus show that the native people
of the Bahamas suffered much from the attacks of the man-eating Caribs,
whom they greatly feared but often doubtless bravely repelled. We
have also evidence from Vespucci that the Caribs advanced much farther
north for war and rapine, boldly navigating the sea in their great canoes,
to Pamlico Sound. Whether they had a permanent settlement on the
northwestern islands of the Bahama group, can probably never be known;
but I believe that either they or the more peaceable Bahama islanders
there were attacked, defeated, and many of them captured and sold into
slavery, by this Spanish expedition.</p>

<p class='c015'>This discussion or explanation, though not directly relating to the
discovery of the Mississippi river, seems to me needful to set forth
my reasons for thinking that Vespucci’s narrative of his first voyage is a
true account, excepting mistakes of his memory or writing or of later
copying.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='small'>“To-morrow is Valentine’s Day. You are mine. I have chose you out among the rest, the
reason is I love you best—so, my Dear, God bless you. I wish you Health and Happiness.”—Isabella
Cleghorn to Capt. Joseph Hynson, in a letter from London dated the 13th of February,
1777, intercepted in the general post-office by the British Secret Service, and now preserved
among the Auckland <em>MSS.</em> in King’s College, Cambridge.</span></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Isabella Cleghorn? Who was she that her valentine fancies
should weigh with nations and be treasured in the archives of a
State? A factor in the birth of the American republic? Let those
so minded review the evidence and construct an answer to suit themselves.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the events of our Revolutionary war destroyed commerce with
the mother country, it followed in nature, if obscurely, that Joseph
Hynson, a young Maryland sea-captain, employed in the London carrying
trade, should find his occupation gone. Beating about in search of a
new one suited to his taste, Hynson shortly betook himself to France,
there to solicit from the American Commissioners some maritime employment
in the service of Congress. Several well-known Marylanders in
Paris at the time vouched for the newcomer as an able seaman and an
honest man. The Commissioners, glad to find a trusty hand, enrolled him
among their elect, and Hynson soon received from them orders to cross
over to Dover, there secretly to purchase a good cutter-sloop. This
vessel, he was told, he should presently command on a voyage across the
Atlantic, bearing despatches to Congress.</p>

<p class='c015'>Once arrived on English soil, it is far from strange that the lively
mariner should have longed for a glimpse of old haunts. The circumspect
gentlemen in Paris would hardly have smiled, however, upon their
emissary’s sally into the heart of London; and his visit to his friends the
Jumps, at their house in Stepney Causeway, spoke little for his sense of
responsibility.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Jump, Hynson’s friend, received him with tender rejoicing.
Robert, her son, echoed the welcome, and pretty little Miss Cleghorn,
neighbor and intimate of the household, promptly surrendered her heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>to the handsome sailor. Hynson, “a lusty and a black-looking fellow,”
with a salt-water gallantry very potent in the feminine eye, warmed under
influences so generous. Discretion melted within him, and before his
departure for Dover he had acquainted his hostess with the secret in his
charge. Anxiety as great as her affection now filled the good woman’s
mind. Sympathizing in private with the American cause, she yet dreaded
so dangerous a service for one she loved. And when, in the newness of
her trouble, Mr. Vardill, an American clergyman supposedly “disaffected,”
chanced to call upon her, her distracted wits could not conceal
from his astuteness quite all that loyalty to Hynson demanded.</p>

<p class='c015'>As Fate would have it, this Vardill, good rebel though he seemed to
be, lived, as a matter of fact, “chiefly on his Majesty’s bounty.” Windfalls
such as Mrs. Jump had provided might be turned to excellent use
in his own and his master’s interest. Lord North, to whose ante-chamber
he accordingly ran with his news, pronounced “the farther prosecution
of the business a matter of the utmost importance.” And from that
instant Joseph Hynson’s every act came under the surveillance of spies,
agents assailed him with every artifice of corruption, his most careless
note was scrutinized in its passage through the mails; and, finally, poor
Isabella’s innocent, schoolgirl love letters seldom came inviolate to the
eyes for which alone they were intended.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My Lord, I take the liberty of sending to you the enclosed
Letter from Captain Hynson to his Mistress.... The writing
on one side of the Letter is part of a rough draft of a Letter
which his Mistress wrote to him,”</p>

<p class='c018'>says Vardill to North, February 10, 1777. Hynson’s letter is a mere
impersonal account of his safe arrival in Dover, but Isabella’s “rough
draft,” scrawled on the back of her lover’s page, seems yet warm with
the pressure of the hand that wrote by the flicker of Mrs. Jump’s
firelight:</p>

<p class='c017'>“——for my Part I have not slept one hour since your (departure).”
[Vardill, in his hasty theft, tore away the sheet so closely as
to sacrifice the end of each line.] “I come over (to the Jumps’) as
often as I can, but not with such (frequency) as I us’d, for I detest
the kitchen and the Arm chair (now). We all do. You will make
(us) very happy if you will (come) and fill it up again, for Gods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Sake Come home for I am (like) one out of their sences about you....
For Gods sake write to me,&#160;... for I am wreatched
all (ways). Did you think that Id spare a Groat for Postage. No,
not even if I been distressed for it. Mrs. Jump (would) lend it
me, so don’t let that be your Excuse, as I (think) you Cant have
forgot me in a week. Write——, and send to Mrs. Jump, and
Come home——”</p>

<p class='c015'>A second sad little letter, dated February 13, met another fate.
Intercepted and copied in the General Post-Office, it was then restored
scatheless to the mail and allowed to go its way. The copy alone is
found in the Auckland <em>MSS.</em></p>

<div class='lg-container-l c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To Captain Hynson, Ship Tavern, Dover:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“I rec’d your kind Letter which affords me great pleasure, as it
allways does to hear from them that I so dearly love. I should have
wrote to you before but Mrs. Jump said I must wait a Day or two,
but with great Anxiety I waited.... I have been in great
distress about you. Night and Day you are Never out of my
Thoughts, my dear Hynson. I must leave off, for I was not certain
whether I should write or no.... My dear Hynson, write to
me as often as you can, for that’s all the happiness I have, to hear
from you——”</p>

<p class='c015'>Two days later, in a sudden access of fear of the dangerous adventure
the nature of which her lover was concealing from her, Isabella
wrote again:</p>

<p class='c017'>“——Dear Hynson, I am afraid you are going to engage in
such a thing that will be a means for us to never met again. Oh
Hynson, as you will not be open and candid enough to tell me what
plan you are upon, I must submit—I long to see you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Others, writing to Hynson from the house in Stepney Causeway,
confirm Isabella’s account of her melancholy. “As to poor Bell, you have
not been out of her head since you have been gone,” Mrs. Jump wrote
him, while Robert added a postscript merely to say:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Bell’s kind love (she bother’d me so I could not help it).”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>In a letter of his own Robert wrote:</p>

<p class='c017'>“As to my Sister Bell’s Behaviour, for Mamma has adopted
her [as a] daughter.... She has been nowhere but to Mrs.
Hazelden’s and our house since you went, and you have all this time
engrossed all her Thoughts and Discourses.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And a casual visitor to the household contributed, banteringly:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am now sitting beside Mrs. Jump and your fair Isabella,
who sends off a Letter to you, and we shall all plague you till we
have you again by the Fireside with us, for we can’t spare You.
You are a happy Fellow to be so necessary to the Happiness of the
Fair. I long to crack a bottle with you once more, and could wish
that the summer was come, that we might have a little Junketting
about the Country together.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Hynson himself, writing from Dover to Mrs. Jump, said teasingly,
for Isabella’s overhearing:</p>

<p class='c017'>“You desire me to come back to be tormented by that little
Girl, but that is out of the question.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Yet when a day or two passed without bringing news of the “little
Girl,” he grew uneasy, especially in view of the chance of having to
quit the country without a farewell message from her.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our vessel is not yet ready,” [he told Robert] “but I expect
her every minute, when I shall proceed to France, where I long to
be.... I am engaged in a manner very agreeable to myself.
I shall have an Opportunity now of exerting myself in my Country’s
Cause, which is the height of my Ambition.... <em>If I don’t
get a letter from Bell this evening I shall sit down in the morning
and write her a Discharge.</em>”</p>

<p class='c015'>But the coveted letter, delayed, probably, by secret-service Philistines,
arrived in the nick of time to prevent so desperate a measure:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dear Mother,” [wrote its recipient to Mrs. Jump], “I
received your kind Letter Thursday night&#160;... and on Friday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Night one from that little Rogue Belle. I have been reading them
ever since.... I have wrote a long Letter to Bell, which I
hope she will pay some attention to, as I should not write in the
manner I have done if she were indifferent to me. Tell her to be a
good Girl.... The reason of my stiling you Mother, is, Bob
says you have adopted Bell your Daughter, and if she is a good Girl
I must call her Sister—or something else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>At last, after many vexatious delays, the vessel was secured and
Hynson set sail for France, the haven of his ambition. But his final
thought was for Isabella:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have enclosed a letter to my little Girl,” [he wrote to a
friend,] “which I shall desire your care of. You will take care it
goes to Mrs. Jump.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And the first mail coming from Havre after Hynson’s arrival there
brought under the eye of the English agent a packet for “Miss Isabella
Cleghorn”—a long letter full of good-humored chatter about men,
women, and fashions, but ending very seriously with this significant
passage:</p>

<p class='c017'>“My Dear Girl:&#160;... I don’t doubt but if I have success
my present situation will be very advantageous&#160;... when I
shall be able to receive you with open arms. Till then I shall only
wish to hear from you. I shall lose no opportunity of writing to
you.... Believe me to be at all times, yours affectionately,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>JOS. HYNSON.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>So, very simply, moved this obscure love-affair of long ago. Yet
the thought that its consequences might involve the destinies of nations
may often have passed through its hero’s mind—a mind essentially
intriguing and filled with keen ambition untrammelled by doubt. Nor was
the man’s assurance without its legitimate base. Trusted, on the one hand
with an important mission in his country’s service, promised the care of
affairs of yet greater weight, and cognizant of a multitude of secrets of
state, Hynson wielded no inconsiderable power. And when, on the other
hand, the chief ministers of the throne completed the circle of his influence
by making him an object of flattering solicitations, he felt that his hour
was indeed come, and wrote, in frank exultation:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“I now think myself a man of consequence, and am very happy.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And now for the bias of the man. In the matter of politics, Hynson,
like many a greater statesman, hoped for reconciliation without separation.
Colonial independence thrown into the scale, his respect for the
integrity of the kingdom weighed heavily against it, and this delicate
balance of his public principles gave to his private interests a possibly
decisive importance. England, the centre of royal government, commanded
his abstract veneration. England, Isabella’s home, held his
heart and his pleasure. “He hopes&#160;... to entitle Himself to a
Competence and to sit down in England, where he has a Connection which
he is anxious to resume,” the King learned from his agents. To that tune
the royal money-bags forthwith jingled cunningly.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>II.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Though the name of neither Hynson or his sweetheart figures in any
of the serious histories of the day, only an unforeseen incident prevented
his, at least, from being there recorded. Isabella’s influence was to
change all his original program. It now remains to show how serious
were the results of Hynson’s uncertain faith, and with what measure of
plausibility Isabella Cleghorn may be called an actual though humble and
unconscious factor in the creation of the American republic.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hynson, as has already been stated, was a man possessed of ambition,
self-confidence, and a love of intrigue. Half his heart’s desire was to see
an early reconciliation of mother-country and colony; the other half to
be himself the maker of the peace. His connection with the American
Commission to Versailles he consequently regarded purely as a means to
this end—his intimacy with the Commission’s affairs as a password to the
confidence of Downing Street. Never fearing to match his own wit against
that of two nations, he clung to the idea that England must be brought
to offer to America acceptable terms of compromise before the conclusion
of a Franco-American understanding should lend new courage to the
rebellious colony. And English diplomatists astutely upheld his faith in
his own powers of high accomplishment: “<span lang="fr">Ce Capitaine continue à voir
le Ld. Stormont, qui lui fait l’accueil le plus capable de le flatter</span>,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Gérald, in his report of April 3, 1777. “<span lang="fr">Cet homme simple, honnête
mais bien intentionné, en a la tête tournee et se croit destiné â être le pacificateur
des deux nations.</span>”</p>

<p class='c015'>The first move in Hynson’s cloudy scheme involved the delivery to
the British of certain valuable despatches going from the Commissioners
to Congress. As bearer of these papers, which were to be placed in his
hands by Franklin in person, the agent lay under orders to sail from
Havre about March 10, in the cutter-sloop that he himself had smuggled
over from Dover for the purpose. Lords North and Suffolk, being
informed accordingly, despatched Lieut.-Col. Edward Smith to Havre,
“furnished with £800 on account, in case it should become necessary to
make use of money.” No sooner had Smith opened negotiations, however,
than a new feature of the scheme developed. Hynson’s complaisance
had its limits, and he utterly refused to turn over the despatches in simple
barter. “Persuasion hangs not on my tongue to attain it,” wrote Smith.
The precious papers must be forcibly wrested from their keeper, on the
very deck of his vessel. Every interest, therefore, turned to that vessel’s
capture.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The sloop” [Smith told his principals across the Channel]
“is hawl’d up into the most private part of the harbour, and the
King’s Dock. Men are at work upon her with all expedition. I
mean that she shall be stuffed with everything that is good, to make
her a better and more valuable prize.... So tell your ships
to be well apprized.... You had better have sixty ships out
than miss her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Admiralty responded promptly. Vessels of war on Channel
stations received minute instructions toward effecting so important a capture.
No precaution was spared, yet in the event all proved vain, for
Hynson was balked of his commission.</p>

<p class='c017'>“A Schooner arrived in the Mean Time at Nantz from Baltimore,”
[explained Smith] “with News of the Hessian Misfortune,
which determined Messrs. Deane and Franklin to wait for more
Events&#160;... to send their Despatches&#160;... and to
employ Hynson, on whose Courage &#38; Seamanship they place great
Confidence, in some other Service.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Foiled in his first design, Hynson now proceeded upon a new one—that
of gathering from the Commission to Versailles such news of
American affairs as, placed in British hands, might serve his object.
Some of these gleanings he gave to Lord Stormont, in Paris, some he confided
to Smith, “whom he met as often as they found it convenient,” and
some travelled by post to England, under protection of the covers of
Admiral Rodney, Hynson’s fellow-lodger in a Parisian inn.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In doing this,” said Smith, whose relations with Hynson were
always most friendly, “he found the Character &#38; Situation of the
several People with whom he has to do very favorable to his Purpose.
Franklin lives at a little Distance from Paris, but seldom
passes a Day without seeing Deane; the latter appears to be the
More active &#38; efficient Man, but less circumspect and Secret, his
Discretion not being always proof against the natural Warmth of
his temper &#38; being weakened also by his own Ideas of the importance
of his present Employment. His Residence is at the Hotel
d’Hombourg, where he keeps a regular Table for such of his
Countrymen as are engaged in the service of the Congress
(Carmichael, Weeks, Hynson, Nicholson, Moyland, Franklin’s
Grandson, and others).... Hynson, who is a free, easy
Fellow, &#38; in good Graces of the whole Party, has a real regard for
Carmichael &#38; labours hard to draw him into the same system with
himself.... It is certainly material, if he succeeds. For tho’
both Deane and Franklin may be, &#38; are, according to Carmichael’s,
account, too ambitious &#38; Determined (or, in other Words, too
malevolent against Great Britain,) ever to adopt any line of conduct
short of American Independence, yet Deane and Franklin can, in
themselves, individually, do little, &#38; if they are betrayed by those
whom they must employ, their Agency will soon come to Disgrace
&#38; Despair.”</p>

<p class='c015'>No ships bearing arms or stores left France for America unknown to
the English Admiralty if Hynson’s diligence could prevent it. And
Hynson’s diligence seldom slept. During all this period, Deane’s confidence
in his agent never faltered. Toward the end of May, 1777, he
wrote to John Hancock concerning him:</p>

<p class='c017'>“——I must in duty to my Country say, I believe he will render&#160;... good service in the Navy, being a good Seaman, &#38; of a
cool, sedate, and Steady Temper of mind.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Again, on the 5th of September, he says: “I can answer for his
fidelity,” of which confidence a conclusive proof shortly came forward.
On the 7th of October Deane informed Hynson, then in Havre de Grace:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Commissioners are sending a packet to America &#38; by
this conveyance Capt’n Folger has been wrote to, to take the charge
of it if not otherwise engaged, but as it is of importance that this
packet goes by safe hands,&#160;... if he cannot go,&#160;... I
must depend on your executing the commission.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The story of the packet’s arrival at the little lodging-house in Havre
where Folger and Hynson lived together is thus succinctly told by Lieut.
Col. Smith:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Folger being ready and willing to sail away with them immediately,
Hynson took an opportunity of sending Folger out upon
some business in the Docks, while he, slipping off the string which
was intended to secure the end of the packett, gott possession of the
despatches,&#160;... and then, making up paper equal in length
and thickness to what he had taken out, he dextrously filled up the
vacancy, shutt up the end of the bundle, passed back again the same
string; and upon Folger’s returning with a Mr. Moyland, he had the
bundle well cover’d, put in a bag, seal’d and deliver’d it to Folger in
presence of Moyland, never to be given again out of Folger’s hands
(unless to be thrown overboard in case of meeting with one of our
ships, or into the hands of those they are directed for).”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Leaving behind an excuse for his absence, skilfully prepared to hoodwink
Deane, Hynson then hurried over to London, carrying the precious
papers with him. Official England delighted in the prettiness of the
trick.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dear Eden,” [wrote the Earl of Suffolk]. “I am tickled with
uncommon pleasure&#160;... at the neat manœuvre by which
Hynson has&#160;... proved himself an honest Rascal. He well
deserves his reward. I desire I may communicate (the despatches)
myself to Lord Mansfield.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And Eden, in joy too great for formal phrases, informs the King’s
self that Hynson “is an honest Rascal, and no fool.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So it happened that poor, gulled Folger eventually delivered to Congress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>with all due ceremony, a package of blank paper, and was cast into
prison for his pains. Duplicate despatches sent out by the Commission
soon after Folger’s departure were lost at sea, and in consequence of the
two calamities no official intelligence reached Congress from France
between May, 1777, and May 2, 1778, the day of the arrival of the
French treaty.</p>

<p class='c015'>As to the effect of this circumstance, Deane is somewhat explicit.
Mentioning Hynson’s exploit as “the only instance of our having our
despatches intercepted,” he continues:</p>

<p class='c017'>“At the time of making out the despatches our prospects both
in France and in America were extremely discouraging. The Court
of France appeared to view our cause as absolutely desperate, and
even the appearance of what little countenance they had before
shown us they gave the most unequivocal proofs of their resolution
to disavow and leave us to our fate.... The Commissioners
were at that time refused any access to the Minister, even in the most
secret manner.</p>

<p class='c017'>“... The Commrs. had not, for some time previous to
this date, sent any information of their situation to Congress, for
they scarcely knew what to write, and hitherto they had said nothing
in a discouraging style, but, on the contrary, had said everything they
could&#160;... to encourage Congress to persevere, and ultimately
to expect aid from France. In these (Folger’s despatches), though,&#160;... they could not avoid the mention of facts from which the
most unfavourable conclusions must have been drawn by Congress
had Folger arrived with the dps. instead of blank paper....</p>

<p class='c017'>“... On the other hand, the British Ministers, from the
contents of those despatches and letters, found in what state we were
with the Court of Versailles.... This encouraged them to
prosecute the war with vigour, confident that it must soon terminate
successfully on their part.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The result of Hynson’s plot, if Deane’s conclusions be accepted, was,
therefore, directly contrary to his aim. By his diversion of the despatches,
British hopes were raised and British offers of concession delayed until
the critical moment had passed and America’s courage had risen beyond
all thought of compromise. Thanks to Hynson’s intervention,</p>

<p class='c017'>“when the Commissioners on the part of Great Britain eventually
arrived in America to propose terms of accommodation to Congress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>no discouraging intelligence had been received&#160;... from the
Commissioners in Paris, and they (Congress) still relied on the
effect which the victory at Saratoga was expected to have in their
favour. They were not, as the event has shown, deceived.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“In every age of the world,” Deane reflects, “many, if not
most of the greatest events, have been produced from the most
trifling causes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A defensible, if not a profitable, argument might be brought forward
to prove the “honest Rascal” the savior of the republic. And, to split a
hair still finer, Isabella Cleghorn might, by the same token, be hailed as
that savior’s inspiration.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lord Stormont believed in Hynson’s sincerity as would-be conciliator
of the contending powers. Deane, despite heavy evidence, was never
perhaps wholly convinced of his agent’s venality. And Hynson himself
again and again protested to Smith:</p>

<p class='c017'>“My motives are not interest,” or, “while ever there is a prospect
of the disputes being settled I shall still be in hopes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Is the secret of these contradictions to be found in Smith’s sly, early
hint:</p>

<p class='c017'>“He has a connection in England which he is anxious to
resume?”</p>

<p class='c015'>And in Hynson’s own words to Isabella:</p>

<p class='c017'>“My dear girl, if I have success I shall be able to receive you
with open Arms.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Certainly the King’s gift of a round sum in cash, a pension of £200
yearly, and, if Deane be right, a rank in the English navy, placed that
consummation well within his reach, while his ensuing desertion of the
stirring life that his soul had loved and retirement into country solitude
pointed strongly toward a master motive satisfied. Samson was shorn
and drawn into paths of inglorious peace. “God knows what he does!”
said a wondering witness. “He dwells with his wife in a little country
house, a quarter of a mile out the town.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CIVIL WAR SKETCHES.<br> CONFEDERATE FINANCE IN ALABAMA</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c013'>BANKS AND BANKING</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>In a circular letter dated December 4, 1860, addressed to the banks,
Governor Moore announced that should the State secede from the
Union, as seemed probable, $1,000,000 in specie or its equivalent,
would be needed by the administration. The State bonds could not be
sold in the North, nor in Europe except at a ruinous discount, and a tax
on the people at this time would be inexpedient. Therefore he recommended
that the banks hold their specie. Otherwise there would be a
run on them and should an extra session of the Legislature be called to
authorize the banks to suspend specie payments, such action would produce
a run and thus defeat the object. He requested the banks to
suspend specie payments, trusting to the convention to legalize this
action.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c023'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The Governor then issued an address to the people stating his
reasons for such a step. It was done, he said, at the request and by the
advice of many citizens whose opinions were entitled to respect and consideration.
Such a course, they thought, would relieve the banks from a
run during the cotton season, enable them to aid the State, do away with
the expense of a special session of the Legislature, prevent the sale of
State bonds at a great sacrifice, and prevent extra taxation of the people
in time of financial crisis.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c023'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Three banks—the Central, Eastern, and Commercial—suspended
at his request and made a loan of $200,000 in coin to the State. Their
suspension was legalized later by an ordinance of the convention. The
Bank of Mobile, and the Northern and the Southern Banks refused to
suspend, though they announced that the State should have their full
support. The Legislature passed an act in February, 1861, authorizing
the suspension, on condition that the banks subscribe for 10-year State
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>bonds at their par value. The bonds were to stand as capital, and the
bills issued by the banks upon these bonds were to be receivable in payment
of taxes. The amount which each bank was to pay into the
Treasury for the bonds was fixed, and no interest was to be paid by the
State on these bonds until specie payments were resumed. All the banks
suspended under these acts, and thus the government secured most of the
coin in the State.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c023'><sup>[3]</sup></a> In October, 1861, before all the banks had suspended,
State bonds at par to the amount of $975,066.68 had been sold—all
but $28,500 to the banks. By early acts specie payments were to
be resumed in May, 1862, but in December, 1861, the suspension was
continued until “one year after the conclusion of peace with the United
States.” By this law the banks were to receive at par the Confederate
Treasury notes in payment of debts, their notes being good for public
dues. The banks were further required to make a loan of $200,000
to the State to pay its quota of the Confederate war tax of August 16,
1861. (The privilege of suspension was evidently worth paying for.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c023'><sup>[4]</sup></a>)</p>

<p class='c015'>The banking law was revised by the convention so that a bank might
deposit with the State comptroller stocks of the Confederate States or of
Alabama, receiving in return notes countersigned by the comptroller
amounting to twice the market value of the bonds deposited. If a bank
had on deposit with the comptroller under the old law any stocks of the
United States, they could be withdrawn upon the deposit of an equal
amount of Confederate stocks or bonds of the State. The same ordinance
provided that none except citizens of Alabama and members of
State corporations might engage in the banking business under this law.
But no rights under the old law were to be affected. It was further provided
that subsequent legislation might require any “free” bank to
reduce its circulation to an amount not exceeding the market value of the
bonds deposited with the comptroller. The notes thus retired were to be
cancelled by the comptroller.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c023'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The suspension of specie payments was
followed by an increase of banking business; note issues were enlarged;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>eleven new banks were chartered,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c023'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and none wound up affairs. They
paid dividends regularly of from six to ten per cent. in coin, or Confederate
notes, or in both. Speculation in government funds was quite
profitable to the banks.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>ISSUES OF BONDS AND NOTES</h3>

<p class='c016'>The convention authorized the General Assembly of the State to
issue bonds to such amounts and in such sums as seemed best, thus giving
the Assembly practically unlimited discretion. But it was provided that
money must not be borrowed except for purposes of military defense,
unless by a two-thirds vote of the members elected to each house; and the
faith and credit of the State was pledged for the punctual payment of
principal and interest.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c023'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The Legislature hastened to avail itself of this permission. In
1861, a bond issue of $2,000,000 for defense, and not liable to taxation,
was authorized at one time; at another, $385,000 for defense besides an
issue of $1,000,000 in treasury notes receivable for taxes. Of the first
issue authorized only $1,759,500 was ever issued. Opposition to taxation
caused the State to take up the war tax of $2,000,000 (August 19,
1861), and for this purpose $1,700,000 in bonds were issued, the banks
supplying the remainder. There was a relaxation in taxation during
the war; paper money was easily printed, and the people were opposed to
heavy taxes.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c023'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>In 1862, bonds to the amount of $2,000,000 were issued for the
benefit of the indigent. The Governor was given unlimited authority to
issue bonds and notes, receivable for taxes, to “repair the treasury,” and
$2,085,000 in bonds was issued under this permit. These bonds drew
interest at 6%, ran for 20 years, and sold at a premium of from 50% to
100%. Bonds were used both for civil and for military purposes, but
chiefly for the support of the destitute. Treasury notes to the amount of
$3,500,000 were issued, drawing interest at 5%, and receivable for taxes.
The Confederate Congress came to the aid of Alabama with a grant of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>$1,200,000 for the defense of Mobile.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c023'><sup>[9]</sup></a> In 1863, notes and bonds for
$4,000,000 were issued for the benefit of indigent families of soldiers,
and $1,500,000 for defense; $90,000 in bonds was paid for the steamer
<em>Florida</em>, which was later turned over to the Confederate government.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c023'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
In 1864, $7,000,000 were appropriated for the support of indigent
families of soldiers and an unlimited issue of bonds and notes was
authorized.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c023'><sup>[11]</sup></a> In 1862, the Alabama Legislature proposed that each State
should guarantee the debt of the Confederate States in proportion to its
representation in Congress. This measure was opposed by the other
States, and failed.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c023'><sup>[12]</sup></a> A year later a resolution of the Legislature declared
that the people of Alabama would cheerfully submit to any tax, not too
oppressive in amount or unequal in operation, laid by the Confederate
government for the purpose of reducing the volume of currency and
appreciating its value. The Assembly also signified its disapproval of the
scheme put forth at the bankers’ meeting at Augusta, Georgia—to issue
Confederate bonds with interest payable in coin and to levy a heavy tax
of $60,000,000 to be paid in coin or in coupons of the proposed new
issue.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c023'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The Alabama treasury had many Confederate notes received in taxes.
Before April 1, 1864, (when such notes were to be taxed one-third of
their face value), these could be exchanged at par for 20-year 6% Confederate
bonds. After that date the Confederate notes were fundable at
33⅓% of their face value only.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c023'><sup>[14]</sup></a> After June 14, 1864, the State treasury
could exchange Confederate notes for 4% non-taxable Confederate bonds,
or one-half for 6% bonds and one-half for new notes. The Alabama
Legislature of 1864 arranged for funding the notes according to the
latter method.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c023'><sup>[15]</sup></a> The Alabama Legislature of 1861 had made it lawful
for debts contracted after that year to be payable in Confederate notes.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c023'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
Later, a meeting of the citizens of Mobile proposed to ostracise those who
refused to accept Confederate notes. Cheap money caused a clamor for
more, and the heads of the people were filled with <span lang="la">fiat</span> money notions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>The rise in prices stimulated more issues of notes. On February 9, 1861,
$1,000,000 in State Treasury notes was issued and in 1862, there was a
similar issue of $2,000,000 more. These State notes were at a premium
in Confederate notes, which were discredited by the Confederate Funding
Act of February 17, 1864. Confederate notes were eagerly offered for
State notes, but the State stopped the exchange.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c023'><sup>[17]</sup></a> December 13, 1864,
a law was passed providing for an unlimited issue of State notes redeemable
in Confederate notes and receivable for taxes.</p>

<p class='c015'>Private individuals often issued notes on their own account, and an
enormous number was put into circulation. The Legislature, by a law of
December 9, 1862, prohibited the issue of “shin-plaster” or other
private money under penalty of $20 to $500 fine, and any person circulating
such money was to be deemed the maker. It was not successful,
however, in reducing the flood of private tokens; the credit of individuals
was better than the credit of the government.</p>

<p class='c015'>Executors, administrators, guardians, and trustees were authorized
to make loans to the Confederacy, and to purchase and receive for debts
due them bonds and Treasury notes of the Confederacy and of Alabama,
and the interest coupons of the same. One-tenth of the Confederate
$15,000,000 loan of February 28, 1861 was subscribed in Alabama.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c023'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
In December 1863, the Legislature laid a tax of 37½% on bonds of the
State and of the Confederacy unless the bonds had been bought directly
from the Confederate government or from the State.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c023'><sup>[19]</sup></a> This was to
punish speculators. After October 7, 1864, the State Treasurer was
directed to refuse to receive for taxes (except at a discount of ⅓) Confederate
notes issued before the date of the Funding Act (Feb. 17, 1864).
Later, Confederate notes were taken for taxes at their full market value.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c023'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Gold was shipped through the blockade at Mobile to pay the interest
on the State bonded debt held in London. It has been charged that this
money was borrowed from the Central, Commercial, and Eastern Banks
and was never repaid, recovery being denied on the ground that the State
could not be sued.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c023'><sup>[21]</sup></a> But the banks received State and Confederate bonds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>under the new banking law in return for their coin. The exchange was
willingly made, for otherwise the banks would have had to continue specie
payments or forfeit their charters. And to continue specie payments meant
immediate bankruptcy.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c023'><sup>[22]</sup></a> After the war, the State was forbidden to pay
any debt incurred in aid of the war, nor could the bonds issued in aid of
the war be redeemed. The banks suffered just as all others suffered, and
it is difficult to see why the State should make good the losses of the
banks in Confederate bonds, and not make good the losses of private
individuals. To do either would be contrary to the Fourteenth
Amendment.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>EARLY LEGISLATIVE TURMOILS IN NEW JERSEY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Pessimists point to the “frenzied politics” of our day as
evidence of the <span lang="la">facilis descensus Averni</span> from the purity, the lofty
and unselfish patriotism of the fathers; and they sigh over the
decadence of the statesmen of these modern times, lament the corruption
and essential dishonesty of parties and partisans in general, and
yearn for a return of the purity and patriotism and statesmanship of the
Fathers. The student of history, however, finds that human nature was
and has been much the same through all the ages. The business contracts
between merchants of Babylon, stamped on bricks five thousand years ago,
and brought to light but yesterday, are in much the same terms as those
settled in the courts to-day. The Code of Hammurabi, formulated 2200
B. C., shows in every sentence that like questions of rights and wrongs
of persons and things were raised in that remote era as are discussed in
the luminous pages of Blackstone, and determined in our own day in the
fori of the several States, and in the Capitol at Washington. Is it possible,
then, that the development of mankind has been on entirely different
lines in the political arena? The thoughtful reader must say no. Freeman’s
remark has become trite: “History is past politics, and politics
past History.” The burning political issues of the Virginia and Kentucky
Resolutions of 1799; the purchase of Louisiana; the Embargo of
1807–09; the annexation of Texas; the Oregon question, with its alluring
alliteration “Fifty-four-forty or fight;” “Bleeding Kansas” and its
other expressions, “Free Speech, Free Soil, Free Men;” Anti-Slavery,
Abolitionism and Secession; the Greenback craze—not to speak of more
recent partisan shibboleths—all were “politics” of the intensest sort in
their day. All are now relegated to the background of “history,” to be
studied in the cold <em>chiaro-oscuro</em> of the past. And the men who led the
forces marshaled against each other in those great conflicts.—Ah, “there
were giants in those days!” Yes, but to their contemporaries they were
merely politicians, too often opprobriously dubbed “political tricksters,”
or even “traitors to their country.” What a lot of truth there is in the
late Thomas B. Reed’s cynicism: “A statesman is a dead politician.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The lust for power is one of the deepest instincts of the human
mind. Civilization has not quenched it, but has merely directed it into
new channels. Instead of the savage chieftain who once impressed his
will on his fellow-tribesmen by tomahawk or flint-tipped arrow-head, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>by terrifying shamanism, we have the statesman—“politician,” if you
will—exercising his mastery by all the subtle arts which a keen intellect
and a profound knowledge of men and the influences to which they are
severally and collectively subject, can devise. Here is a splendid field
for the orator, to persuade by his burning eloquence; for the leader, to
show his mastery over men; for the partisan, to cajole with the promise of
sordid spoil, or to threaten the recreant with loss of influence. There is a
glorious zest in this pursuit of power, in this forging to the front as a
leader of men. Admirable ambition, if inspired by worthy motives.
Fascinating, most attractive, to every virile man. What wonder, if in
this eager thirst for eminence among his fellows, the ardent leader
becomes oblivious at times to the relative rights of <span lang="la">meum</span> and <span lang="la">tuum</span>?
Success is his aim. He <em>must</em> win. The future of his party, the welfare
of his country, demands it. No time to palter over finical questions of
what is proper, of what is right. “The end justifies the means.” Ah,
<span lang="la">facilis est descensus Averni</span>, indeed.</p>

<p class='c015'>All this by way of preliminary to a few gleanings from some old
records of New Jersey, illustrating “past politics” principally in the days
of that erstwhile Royal Province, under that unique Chief Executive,
Lord Cornbury, who was foisted on the people by his amiable cousin,
Queen Anne, doubtless glad enough of the chance to banish him by an
ocean’s broad expanse from her Court. For a score of years New Jersey
had been divided into two Provinces—East Jersey, largely controlled by
the Scotch proprietors and their settlers; and West Jersey, dominated by
the outwardly meek but inwardly determined Quakers. When the two
Provinces were reunited into one—New Jersey—the profligate courtier,
the ruffling gallant, the soldier of doubtful reputation, Lord Cornbury,
of all men was chosen as the solvent to blend these and all the other
antagonistic elements in the Province into one harmonious whole.</p>

<p class='c015'>His troubles began with the first election of representatives to the
General Assembly, held between August 13 and September 9, 1703.
That body was to be composed of two members each from Perth Amboy
and Burlington, and ten from each Division—twenty-four in all. (So
long ago was ordained the exact political equality of East Jersey and West
Jersey, which has been scrupulously maintained for two centuries, at least
in the upper branch of the Legislature, regardless of the overwhelming
preponderance of population now concentrated in what was formerly East
Jersey). In the latter Division there appeared at the polls forty-two
qualified voters in the interest of the Scotch Proprietors, a great part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>them from New York and Long Island. “On behalfe of the Country
there appear’d betwixt three &#38; four hundred men qualifyed &#38; had they
thought necessary could have brought severall Hundred more.” But
the High Sheriff (Thomas Gordon) appointed in the Scotch interest,
“multiply’d Tricks, upon Tricks, till at last barefac’d he made ye returne
contrary to the choice of the Country.” So too in West Jersey, the
Quakers, though really in the majority only in Burlington County, “by
their usuall application &#38; diligence” secured the return of ten members.
Lord Cornbury was intensely disgusted at so adverse a result, and complained
to the Lords of Trade that “Severall persons very well qualified
to serve, could not be elected, because they had not a thousand Acres of
Land, though at the same time, they had twice the vallue of that Land,
in money and goods, they being trading men, [while] on the other hand
some were chosen because they have a thousand Acres of Land, and at
the same time have not twenty shillings in money, drive noe trade, and
can neither read nor write, nay they can not answer a question that is
asked them, of this sort we have two in the Assembly.” However, the
Royal Governor was prejudiced against the plebeian Jerseymen.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the House met, November 10, 1703, a petition was presented,
complaining of an undue election of five of the members returned for the
Eastern Division. Sheriff Gordon, at his request, was furnished with a
copy of the petition, and time was given him to answer it, and to send for
such persons as he should find necessary for his defense. Gordon, by
the way, was a member of the House from Perth Amboy, and so had a
great advantage over his adversaries, as he could sit on his own case,
and by judicious logrolling could influence votes in his own behalf. Nor
is there anything in the records to show that he had the slightest hesitation
in availing himself of his opportunities. Apparently he had doubts
about the allegiance of one of his fellow-members, Richard Hartshorne,
for on November 16, Messrs. Gordon and Reid were given permission
to ask the Governor and Council whether Hartshorne was qualified to sit
in the House, and to give their opinion thereon. The Governor advised
Mr. Hartshorne to qualify himself as the law required (by the ownership
of a thousand acres of land), but in the meantime the House ordered
him to withdraw, until he should qualify himself, and he left his seat.
The complaint against Gordon was taken up on November 16, and
evidence produced on both sides on that and two succeeding days. Hartshorne
was unseated on the 17th, and on the 18th it was voted that the
evidence for the regularity and legality of the return made by Mr. Gordon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>was sufficient, and the petition was dismissed. The House declined, however,
to allow the Sheriff his charges against the petitioners. It was also
voted not to take any action against the clerks who took the poll at the
election in Amboy, and who had refused to deliver them to the Sheriff.
It is quite apparent that the House was pretty evenly divided between the
friends and foes of the Sheriff-Assemblyman. It is not unlikely that
Gordon’s finesse in unseating Hartshorne before the final vote was taken
determined the result.</p>

<p class='c015'>Governor Cornbury found the First Assembly so recalcitrant that he
dissolved it, September 28, 1704, and a few days later issued writs for
the election of a new Assembly, to meet at Burlington on November 9,
1704. His enemies charged that “The writs were issued and the Elections
directed to be made, in such hast, that in one of the writs the Qualifications
of the persons to be elected was omitted, and the Sheriff of one
County not sworn till Three days before the Election, and many of the
Townes had not any (much less due) notice of the day of Election.”
Despite these extraordinary precautions of the Governor to have the elections
controlled by his friends there was an adverse majority in the Second
Assembly, when it met at Burlington on November  13, 1704, and
organized the next day. How was this to be overcome? The way was
quickly and readily devised. On November 15, Messrs. Thomas Revel
and Daniel Leeds, two of Cornbury’s staunchest supporters in the Council,
presented a petition to that body, questioning the right of Thomas Lambert,
Thomas Gardiner and Joshua Wright to sit in the House. The
Governor thereupon refused to swear in those three members-elect. The
next day the petitioners asked for fourteen days’ time in which to show
that these men lacked the requisite property qualification of 1,000 acres
of land. The object in asking this long time was to outwear the patience
of the Assembly. The same day (November 16) the members in question
produced to the House copies of returns of surveys of lands possessed
by them, and were given further time to make their qualifications more
fully appear, the result being that on December 6 the House decided that
each of the men owned a thousand acres of land, and voted unanimously
to seat them. Lord Cornbury, however, still declined to administer to
them the prescribed oath. The counties for which the three men were
chosen to serve, with several other representatives, delivered an address
to his Excellency for having them admitted, which, “mett with noe other
Reception, than being called a piece of Insolence, and Ill manners.” By
this exclusion a majority of one was gained for the Governor’s party,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>and he having secured such legislation as he most desired adjourned the
Assembly, December 12, to meet April 27, 1705, leaving the three members-elect
in question to cool their heels on the outside.</p>

<p class='c015'>The House did not meet again until October 17, 1705. The Governor
sent in a message commending sundry measures to be enacted. By
this time the Assembly was ready to lock horns with his Excellency, and
to stand on its rights. It was accordingly resolved that it should be
“full” before considering his suggestions, and a committee was appointed
to wait on him and ask him to admit the three excluded members. He
parried the issue, but the House would  none of his evasions, and decided
to do no business until those three men were admitted. The Governor
wanted an appropriation for his support, and was compelled to yield and
swear in the men, who took their seats October 26, 1705. The Lords
of Trade disapproved of his course in a letter of April 20, 1705: “We
think, your Lordship will do well to leave the Determination about Elections
of Representatives to that House, and not to intermeddle therein
otherwise than by Issuing of Writs for any new Election.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Does this incident remind one of the “Broad Seal War,” arising
out of the action of the Governor of New Jersey issuing his certificate of
election to five men as Members of Congress, in 1838, who were really
in the minority, on the ground that the returns from certain townships
(which would have changed the result) were not before him in due
season? Or does it in any way recall the attempt of ten members of the
New Jersey Senate to assume to be a majority of the twenty-one members
of that body, in 1894?</p>

<p class='c015'>The Third Assembly, which met at Perth Amboy, April 5, 1707,
was also hostile to the Governor. Two of the members of his Council—the
pugnacious Lewis Morris and the imperturbable, hard-headed Samuel
Jenings, a Quaker—actually resigned from that body in order to be
elected to the Assembly, where they could the better harass his Excellency.
The Governor had assumed the right to appoint the Clerk of the House,
in the person of one William Anderson, who incurred their dislike, and
they resolved to get rid of him. How? By the simple expedient
of resolving themselves into a committee of the whole, wherein from day
to day they discussed the public business, and figuratively “cussed” the
Governor. Of course, the committee had a right to choose its own clerk,
and selected one of the members. Anderson did not like this, and insisted
on his right and duty to sit with them. He imprudently admitted “y<sup>t</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>he was Sworn to discover Debates y<sup>t</sup> were dangerous to y<sup>e</sup> Goverm<sup>t</sup>, &#38; y<sup>t</sup>
he did not know but y<sup>e</sup> Comittee were going to have such Debates, &#38;
y<sup>r</sup>fore did turn him out.” The chairman promptly caught him on this
indiscretion, and exclaimed, “Then you suppose we are going to have
such Debates?” “It looks like it,” replied the clerk. The committee
indignantly resolved that his refusal to withdraw from the committee of
the whole was a “high Contempt, &#38; a great Interruption of y<sup>e</sup> public
Affairs of the Province,” and that his words were a “Misdemeanor &#38; a
scandalous Reflection upon y<sup>e</sup> Members of this House.” Here was a
new grievance whereof to complain to the Governor, and in order to give
him time to think it over the House adjourned for a week, and then sent
a committee to ask him to appoint another clerk, who should be “a
Residenter of this Province.” It may be readily imagined that the Governor
was loth to lose the services of so faithful a henchman, but he was
anxious for another appropriation and was obliged to give way, and
named a new clerk. How impatient he must have been to get that
Assembly “off his hands!” Have there not been Governors, yea, even
Presidents, similarly embarrassed within our own recollection?</p>

<p class='c015'>Now the Assembly had another rod in pickle for the Governor. It
was whispered about that a fund had been raised to bribe him to favor
certain measures in the interest of the Proprietors, and that many citizens
had been virtually compelled to contribute toward this fund, under
threats of serious inconvenience in various ways. The House determined
to investigate these rumors, and sent out subpœnas for a large number of
witnesses. One of the parties implicated was Capt. John Bowne, a member
from Monmouth County. He was a man of resources, and when a
certain witness came to town to testify against him he had the man
arrested on a capias in a civil suit and sent to jail, where he was detained,
all bail being refused. Whereupon the House (April 30, 1707)
promptly expelled Bowne for “a Contempt and a breach of the privileges
of this House,” <em>nem. con.</em> They moved more quickly in those days than
even in this modern era of hustle.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Governor’s exclusion of three members-elect from their seats
was still a sore grievance to the House, and finally that body expressed
itself in language the good sense and dignity of which excuse its eccentric
orthography:</p>

<p class='c015'>“We are too Sensably touched with that procedure not to know what
must be the unavoydable Consequences of the Governor’s refusing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Sweare which of the Members of an Assembly he thinks fitt; but to take
upon himselfe the power of Judging of the qualifications of Assemblymen,
and to keep them out of the house (as the Governour did the afores<sup>d</sup>
three members nigh Eleven Months till he was satisfied in that point)
after the house had declared them qualified, is so great a violation of the
Lyberties of the people, So great a breach of the privileges of the house
of Representatives, So much an assuring to himselfe a negative voyce to
the freeholders Election of their Representatives, that the Governour is
Intreated to pardon us if this is a Different treatment from what he
expected; It is not the Effects of passionate heats or the Transports of
Vindictive Tempers, but the Serious Resentments of a House of Representatives
For a Notorious violation of the liberties of the people to
whom they could not be just nor answer the trust reposed in them Should
they declyne letting the Governor know they are Extremely Dissatisfied
at so unkind a treatment Especially when its Causes and Effects Conspire
to render it so disagreeable.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Lord John Lovelace having succeeded Lord Cornbury as Governor
of New Jersey, ordered an election for a new Assembly, which met at
Perth Amboy March 3, 1708–9. They were not willing to forgive and
forget, any more than are modern partisans. A fulsome address to the
Queen had been adopted in 1707 by the gentlemen of the Council, praising
Lord Cornbury, and assailing the House, and particularly Lewis
Morris and Samuel Jenings, two of its members. The Assembly had got
wind of this document, and now requested a copy from the new Governor,
who caused it to be furnished to them and it was treasured up for future
use.</p>

<p class='c015'>The wheels of legislation rolled smoothly along for several weeks.
There was a sudden jolt, however, on June 11, 1709, when the Council
had the temerity to appoint a committee to inspect the journal of the
House. The latter body at once retorted in kind, by appointing a committee
to inspect the journal of the Council, and desired them to send
their journal to the committee that afternoon! The Council of course
objected, urging that their proceedings were secret; but the House
insisted, and desired to have the journal sent down at seven o’clock the
next morning.</p>

<p class='c015'>And that was the last that was heard of either house attempting to
“inspect” the minutes of the other. The Assembly—the representatives
of the people—had again triumphantly asserted and maintained
their independence.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>The Fifth Assembly, which met and organized December 1, 1709,
had a number of contested elections before it, which were in general
decided in favor of the sitting members. The business of the session
proceeded steadily and with unusual monotony until January 2, 1710,
when it was enlivened by this incident: A certain bill having been
referred to a committee, Mr. Lawrence, one of the members, reported
that “they had blotted out the whole of the bill, except the title, which he
thought was the best amendment they could make to it.” This seemed
to be quite a joke, until the chairman complained that while the committee
were discussing the measure Mr. Lawrence “Did contrary to his Consent
blot out &#38; Cancell the s<sup>d</sup> bill and had left nothing remaining Except the
title. And that M<sup>r</sup> Gershom Mott another of the s<sup>d</sup> Committee forcibly
detained him when he would have departed the room whilst M<sup>r</sup> Lawrence
was blotting and Cancelling some part of the said Bill.” The House
voted that the action of Messrs. Lawrence and Mott was a contempt,
and ordered them to be brought before the bar “and there ask forgiveness,
with an acknowledgement of the favour of the H<sup>os</sup> that they were
not Expelld the H<sup>os</sup> &#38; rendered uncapable for ever Serving in this H<sup>os</sup>
againe &#38; other punish<sup>mts</sup> which this H<sup>os</sup> might inflict. And that they
promise for the Future to behave themselves as becomes Members of this
H<sup>os</sup>.” The two practical jokers made the required <span lang="fr">amende</span> and were
allowed to resume their seats.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was another break in the tedium of the session on January 5,
when “M<sup>r</sup> Sharp Complained that Cap<sup>t</sup> George Duncan this morning,
Early had called him out privately &#38; drew his Sword upon him unawares
he being unarmed, &#38; made at him with his drawn Sword, upon which the
said Sharp fled &#38; was pursued by the s<sup>d</sup> Cap<sup>t</sup> Duncan who hee believes
had a designe to kill him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And desired the protection of y<sup>e</sup> h<sup>os</sup>.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Capt. Duncan was ordered into the custody of the sergeant-at-arms,
and to be kept disarmed until further orders. There he was detained for
six days, when, being apparently both sober and sorry, and having asked
Mr. Sharp’s forgiveness, he was brought before the House, made his
apologies all around and “promised to behave himself for the future as
becom’s a Loyall Subject and a good member of this House,” and was
allowed to take his seat.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Assembly elected in 1716 was violently rent by factions for and
against the impatient and impetuous Governor Robert Hunter. Col.
Daniel Coxe, who had served for several years in the Council, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>removed at Hunter’s request, and forthwith set about getting even. To
that end he secured his election to the Assembly in 1714, having cleverly
manipulated the “Swedish vote” on his immense paternal estates in the
southern part of the Province. He was again chosen in February, 1716,
from both Gloucester County and the town of Salem, although Sheriff
William Harrison, of Gloucester, was accused of resorting to sharp
practice to secure his defeat, by removing the polls several miles from the
usual place of holding the election. Coxe declared to serve for Gloucester,
and being chosen Speaker on April 4, lodged a complaint against
Harrison, had him arraigned at the bar of the House, and by order of
that body publicly reprimanded him. Governor Hunter was intensely
disappointed at the result of the election, and prorogued the Assembly
until May 7. On that day the members in opposition stayed away, to
prevent a quorum, but after two weeks the friends of the Governor
managed to get together thirteen members—a bare majority,—and
elected John Kinsey Speaker in the absence of Coxe, and then proceeded
to expel Coxe and his whole party for non-attendance, and moreover
declared them incapable forever of sitting in that body. Several of them
were re-elected, nevertheless, and were gently but firmly again expelled.</p>

<p class='c015'>I might speak of the action of the West Jersey Assembly in 1685–6,
when they “declared to y<sup>e</sup> Governor y<sup>t</sup> officers of State &#38; Trust belong to
them to nominate and appoint.” And to that other assertion of their
independence when they refused to recognize the course of the Proprietors
in appointing John Tatham as Governor. Even in the opening days of
the Revolution, when the friends of the new government were welded by
the force of circumstances into a harmonious body, strongly disposed to
uphold the patriotic Governor, William Livingston, they nevertheless
enunciated an important construction of the constitution, in 1778, in
declaring void a patent granted by him, incorporating a church, after the
manner of his Royal predecessors, and asserting that “the power of
granting patents and charters of incorporation, under the present constitution,
is vested solely in the Legislature of the State.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Something has been said in this paper of the scandalous conduct of
elections. It is gratifying to find a popular reaction as early as 1738, at
least in Quaker Burlington, where, though the election was so vigorously
contested as to require three days to conclude the polling, it was, notwithstanding,
managed “in such a candid and peaceable Manner,” according
to a newspaper of the day, “as gave no Occasion of Reflection to each
other, nor was there any reaping of Characters, or using of Canes in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Hostile Manner on one another, being sensible that such a Practice is
inconsistent with the Freedom which ought to Subsist in our Elections.”
The inference is irresistible that the conduct of this canvass was in violent
contrast with the usual practices.</p>

<p class='c015'>I might also mention the passage of an act by the Legislature seventy
years or so ago, providing for an increase in the membership of the
Supreme Court, and then the appointment by the same Legislature of one
of its own members to the office thus created! The appointee was an
honor to the Bench, and ranked then and for thirty years afterwards as
one of the most distinguished men in the land. But what would be
thought of such a procedure to-day?</p>

<p class='c015'>And speaking of courts, I do not recall anything in recent times to
match the daring of the Monmouth County people, who on March 25,
1701, captured the Governor of East Jersey, two of his Councillors and
two of his Justices, who were holding court for the trial of a townsman
on a charge of piracy, he having confessed that he had been on a voyage
with the famous Captain William Kidd, “as he sailed, as he sailed.”
The people would not “stand for” judicial interference in a little thing
like that, which brought plenty of “Arabian gold” to our coasts, and so,
with grim humor and determination, they kept the Governor and his
Court of Sessions, together with the Attorney-General and the Secretary
of the Province, in close confinement for four days. As nothing further
is said about the matter it is not unlikely that the prisoners were compelled
to promise immunity to their captors before being released.</p>

<p class='c018'>the modern politician is much the same as his predecessor of two centuries

minority into a majority—is so exceptional to-day as to excite general
surprise, and more or less genuine indignation. In that State ten years
ago it caused a political revolution.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>The golden age of American politics does not lie in the past. It

the eminent men of this day, through the haze of a century, may see our
contemporaries surrounded by as effulgent a glamour as that which to
our eyes enshrines the worthies who guided the first steps of the Nation
along the paths of sure and permanent progress. Let us have faith in
the Republic, and in our present leaders, following where they lead
aright, and leaving them when they go astray; remembering the golden
rule in government, embodied in those matchless words:</p>

<p class='c021'>“That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”</p>

<p class='c015'>When the time comes that our people shall fully live up to that
immortal Declaration we shall see before us and within reach the iridescent
rainbow of our hopes, the harbinger of tranquility after the storms
of past conflicts; then we shall have attained indeed in our political system
and practices to the “golden age.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>WHEN WASHINGTON CAME TO SPRINGFIELD</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>In April, 1905, after the adjournment of Congress, Theodore Roosevelt,
President of the United States, started on a tour of the country.
On Thursday, October 15, 1789, George Washington, President of
the United States, Congress having adjourned, started on a tour of the
New England States. The contrasts brought out by the two journeys are
so striking that it may be of interest to recall the earlier tour, and some of
the conditions under which it was made. President Roosevelt began his
trip in the cab of a locomotive. President Washington started in his
private coach, with much ceremony, attended by six servants. President
Roosevelt travelled thousands of miles to Colorado and Texas, visiting
territory, the existence of which was not even dreamed of in 1789.
Washington went as far from New York as Portsmouth, N. H., and
required a month in which to cover the distance between the two cities.
But it is not so much the outward changes in conditions as the attitude of
the people which is, after all, of the chief interest. The fiction of the
“good old days” is so strongly intrenched in our minds that it is very
difficult to break away from it, yet the absence of bitterness to-day in the
spirit of the public toward the chief magistrate is no less marked a change
than the revolution in physical conditions. President Roosevelt was followed
on his journey by the good will of all the people. There might
be a sly hit, now and then, at his strenuous bear-hunting, rough-riding
proclivities, but the attitude of the people as a whole was respectful and
sympathetic. How the different classes of the people felt toward Washington,
together with some descriptive hints about his journey, I have
endeavored to set forth in the following letters, all drawn from historic
sources, which I suppose to have been written by the following imaginary
personages:—</p>

<p class='c017'>John Adams, a young Springfield lawyer, recently from Boston.</p>

<p class='c017'>Dorothy Coolidge of Boston, a society girl, a friend and former playmate
of John Adams.</p>

<p class='c017'>Enoch Day, keeper of a general store in West Springfield.</p>

<p class='c017'>Peter Colton, farmer of Longmeadow.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>The first letter is addressed to William Armstrong of Pittsfield, and
is written by Peter Colton.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is going on a Year since I have writ a Letter to you, but you know I have not
forgot the man that saved my Life at Monmouth, and I hope you have not forgot Yr
old Sargeant of Co A. I hear you are growing prosperous, and I am glad to hear
it. I take my pen in hand to tell you of the Visit w’ch our old General has made to
Springfield. I thank the Lord that these old Eyes has seen him once more before I
die. I knew he w’ld not stop in our Town, &#38; so I harnessed up the old horse and
took my ten year old boy &#38; started to Springf’ld. After I had bought some Codfish
&#38; molases, I tied up my horse in the First Meeting House Sheds &#38; waited by Zenas
Parsonses Tavern. The General was late, it having rained hard in the Morning, and
he did not reach town till nearly Four. There was a crowd around the Tavern
Steps, but no great Cheers when the General stepped out of his Handsome Coach.
There was several Prominent Gentlemen to meet him, and Zenas, he was a-rubbing
his hands and a-bowing, with all the servants behind him. The boys took the
Horses around to the stables, &#38; the General, he started to go in, when he sees me
standing by the door. What do you suppose he did? There come over his face one
of them smiles of his, like the sun breaking through the clouds on a wintry day,
&#38; he steps up and shakes my hand &#38; he says, Why here’s my old Sargeant. And is
this your Boy? a Fine lad, says he, what is his Name? George Washington Colton,
says I as proud as a Peacock. He laughs, and pulls out a Silver Dollar, and gives
it to the Boy &#38; it will be handed down to his Great grand children, if he has any.
Then the General says, Come up in the Evening, says he, &#38; sit with me and the
other Gentlemen. Thank you Sir, says I, saluting, I will, as soon as milking, and
then he went into the Tavern, for some of the fine Gentlemen was getting quite
impatient, seeing him stand talking so long with a plain farmer like me. And yet
there is some Sneaks who ought to be on the gallows, that says that George Washington
is cold and haughtey, and has no heed for the common People. My paper is
used up, so no more at present from.</p>

<p class='c021'>COUSIN JOSEPH:—It is some time since I have seen you, &#38; I hope that your
business is florishing, and that you &#38; Cousin Elizabeth, and little Betty are well.
I would be getting on prety well if these blustering returned Soldiers had any thing
but their filthy Continental Money to pay with. I had one put in Jail the other day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>old Job Smith, up on the Northampton Road. He came down from his High
Horse, after I got the Sheriff on his back &#38; began to sniffle &#38; whine, and talk
about a sick Wife, &#38; how he had been wounded at Trenton. I tell you, Joseph,
it is our turn now, &#38; we have gott these bare footted heros on the Hip. That
white livered Sneak &#38; Coward, G. Washington, was in Springfield, yesterday. A
lot of Fools dressed up in their best, and went over the river to see him. I hear he
stopped at Zene Parsons’ Tavern, and rode in a fine Coach, with four Horses, and
a whole company of Lackeys to bend &#38; crouch &#38; lick his Boots. He is more like
a King than a president, and they say he grows wors every day. I hear he has
already overdrawed his salary, &#38; has stole $4,000, and I can well believe it. What
any one can see to worship in that man, I cannot understand. He is treacherous
in private Friendship, a hypocrite in public life, and the World will be puzzled to
know whether he is an Apostate or an Imposter, whether he has abandoned his principles
or whether he ever had any. Posterity will say that the Mask of political
hypocricy has been worn by Caesar, by Cromwell, and by Washington. This
journey he is taking is to make political Capital. He wants a second Term in Office,
&#38; he is catering to the vote of New England. He is an aristocrat, a Monocrat, an
Anglomaniac, &#38; an American Caesar. He ought to be the Servant of the People,
but he wants them to bow &#38; treat him like a little King. We had one odious King
George, &#38; now we are burdened with another. He is not the father, but the Stepfather
of the Country. A friend of mine in New York, tells me for a fact, that this
man comitted murder in his youth, &#38; you have doubtless heard of those letters
of his which have been found, that prove beyond the shadow of a Doubt, that this
man, who is hailed as the Saviour of the Country, was really a Coward, that he
was at heart as much of a Traitor as Benedict Arnold, only he lacked Arnold’s
Boldness &#38; Courage to carry it out. I have just received a Pamphlet written by
one Valerius, which ought to be scattered abroad as a patriotic Document. I will
copy one particularly good paragraph for you.</p>

<p class='c029'>“With the Constitution in one hand, and the Word of God in the
other, George Washington swore to defend a republican form of government,
which abhors the insidious machinery of royal imposture. Has he
done so? What have been the fruits of this solemn oath? The seclusion
of a monk, and the supercilious distance of a tyrant. Old habits have been
on a sudden thrown away. Time was, when he more than any other,
indulged the manly walk and rode the generous steed. Now to behold
him afoot or on horseback, is the subject of remark. The concealing
carriage drawn by supernumerary horses, expresses the will of the President,
and defies the will of the people. He receives visits. He returns
none. Are these Republican virtues? Do they command our esteem?”</p>

<p class='c021'>These words, dear cousin, filled with virtuous indignation, yet so elegantly
expressed, are no doubt your sentiments as well as mine. Some of our West Springfield
people, I am glad to say, have shown much spirit in this matter. The last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>time an attempt was made to celebrate the birthday of this odious tyrant, the swabs
were stolen from the cannon, so that no salute could be fired. It will be a happy
day for the Country, when G. Washington, Charlatan, political Trickster, Apostate,
and Coward, is removed from our midst.</p>

      <div class='line'>MY DEAR FRIEND DOROTHY:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>I know that I ought not to write to you again this week, but my clients are
few, and time hangs heavily on my hands, out here in the backwoods. You ask
me if there are no handsome Springfield girls to take my attention, and keep me
from being lonely. There are some very decent-looking young ladies, whom I see
when I attend divine worship in the First Church, but you know very well why I
do not care to cultivate their acquaintance. There is only One—no, I will not
break my promise which I made, not to propose for your hand again for six
months, but you know what I mean. I am going to tell you about the visit which
that noble Patriot &#38; Friend of Mankind, President George Washington, has just
made to Springfield. He was here yesterday. About four o’clock his coach came
up the Main street, horses at a smart trot, and drew up with a flourish in front of
Zenas Parson’s Tavern. There was a small crowd, and three cheers were give
as the President stepped from his coach, but no great enthusiasm, for I am bound
to say that Springfield is an anti-Federalist town, and there is already much grumbling
about the government. The general remained in the tavern but a short time,
when he came out, and mounting a horse set out with several officers up the Boston
road, to visit the Government Stores. I learn that he was well satisfied with the
location and the improvements, and predicts that there will be here one day great
manufactories and warehouses for the making and storing of Munitions of War.
After supper he sat for a couple of hours, until ten o’clock, with a company of
gentlemen in the great room of the Tavern, before a roaring fire, for the nights
are chill. I was invited, no doubt on my father’s account, for whom the General
inquired kindly. There were, among others in the company, Col Worthington,
Col Williams, Adjt. General of the State, Gen William Shepard, Mr Lyman, and
many other respectable gentlemen of the Town. I shall never forget that evening.
His Excellency talked more freely than is his wont. He is loth to speak of his own
achievements, but at the urgent solicitation of Col Williams he told of his part in
the Trenton campaign. He gave great praise to our Massachusetts men, particularly
to the Marblehead fishermen, who ferried the army, men, horses and guns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>across the river, amid the floating ice. I can very well see, Dorothy, how some
men can worship him and others hate him. He is a gentleman, an aristocrat, if
you please, by nature; proud, self-contained, refined in every sense of the word.
Added to that he is afflicted—I think that is the right word—with an abnormal
shyness and reserve. His nature suddenly draws in upon itself, leaving him silent,
diffident, almost glum. He cannot speak at such times. His lips close in a firm
line; he looks like a marble statue. This mood is what some men mistake for
hauteur, pride, arrogance. They call him Caesar, because he does not smirk and
grin, and slap every country Tom and Jerry on the back. And yet, beneath that
cold exterior, there is a nature which can be as warm and as tender as Spring.
Once or twice during the evening he laughed as heartily as any one. I am convinced
that the reserve and apparent exclusiveness, which seems so offensive to some,
is partly a natural dignity, a respect for his position, and partly a disposition which
he cannot help.</p>

<p class='c021'>But there is a quality about him which only the most superficial observer can
fail to notice. The sense of it grew upon me as I sat there and watched the play
of his features in the firelight. Dorothy, he is a great man, the greatest, perhaps,
that our country will ever see. He is cast in the heroic mold. He belongs in
the company of the elect of all the ages. Only once in centuries does Nature form
such a man, and then, like Caesar and Cromwell, he must be misunderstood, because
he walks in a different atmosphere from the common throng. When I was in
college I went on a hunting trip in the New Hampshire wilderness. Away up
there in the Northland, suddenly, from a hilltop, I saw that splendid mountain
peak, which has just been rightly named Washington. Gloriously, above its
fellows, it soared into the sunset sky, remote, inaccessible, companion of the stars,
yet rooted in mother earth, with running stream and birds and flowers about its base.
That is our Washington, and such he must ever be. Once he alluded to the
slanders and vituperations, which cannot but annoy him. He spoke in a voice
which had more of sadness than anger in it. “These attacks,” he said, “are outrages
on common decency. But I have a consolation within that no earthly effort
can deprive me of, and that is, that neither ambition nor interested motives have
influenced my conduct. The arrows of malevolence, therefore, however barbed
and well pointed, can never reach the most vulnerable part of me, though while I
am up as a mark they will be continually aimed.” The truth is, Dorothy, his public
life is one continual martyrdom and self-sacrifice. He does not care for public
life. He loves his farm on the Potomac—his horses and his dogs, his tobacco and
his wheat, and he would be happier there than in any office which the people can
give him. This talk about his being unrepublican is absurd. No man could be
more ardently republican. He went into the war from pure sentiment and love of
the country. He would have fought in the ranks, if his place had not been in
the saddle. He believes, as every man must, in a strong central government,
but monarchial institutions he abhors.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>At the stroke of ten he arose, and we stood and remained standing as he bade
us a gracious good-night and left the room. There was no laughter and loud
talking as we went away. A spell seemed to be upon us, the spell of his dignity
and nobility and greatness. This morning at seven he started for Boston. May
God go with him.</p>

<p class='c021'>I must say good-night, Dorothy. I wish I could see you. Could you not
write more often than once a week? It is very lonely here, but Springfield
is really a lovely place. The river, as it comes sweeping down from the hills, is
beautiful. There is a very pretty society here for a small town, and some assemblies.
I think you love the country. I think that a girl, even one who had been
brought up in Boston, might under certain circumstances be happy here. Good-night,
again, and Farewell.</p>

      <div class='line'>MY DEAR FRIEND JACK:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>You needn’t abuse me so, sir, because I have not written to you for more than
two Weeks. How could I write, with the President here, &#38; so many Balls and
Assemblies. Besides, I write quite as often as is good for you. I had thought of
not writing any more to you, sir. I am afraid that it may interfere with yr important
Business. But I won’t stop—just yet. I have seen yr Paragon, George Washington.
He reached here on Saturday after he was in Springfield, &#38; it was a Gala-day
for Boston. There was a great Procession, Militia, marching very straight
and fine, trades-people, each guild with the Device of its Craft, and many Gentlemen
on horseback. Near the State-house was a triumphal Arch, built acrost the
street. On one side were the words, “The Man Who Unites All Hearts.” On
the Other “To Columbia’s Favorite Son.” On the top of the Arch there was a
stuffed Eagle. The school children were drawn up in line, &#38; saluted by rolling
their writing quills in their hands. The General rode a splendid white Horse,
and looked every inch the hero, in his blue and buff uniform. He held his Hat in
his hand, and bowed slightly to left and right. He went into the State-house, and
came out on the Balcony. Then the great throng below went wild with Enthusiasm.
By and by, when they could be heard, a select Choir sang an Ode written
for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c021'>On Sunday morning his Excellency went to Church &#38; sat in the Pew behind
ours. I had a new hat, which I think is very becoming. It has a large brim, a
gauze crown, &#38; a broad bow with long ends at the back, and it was trimmed with
three Ostrich Feathers. What do you suppose that ridiculous old anti-Federalist
governor Hancock did? He refused to call on the President, saying that it was
the President’s place to call upon his High Mightiness. The People were so angry,
that threats of violence were heard. You know that the President is stopping at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the Widow Ingersoll’s just opposite our house. Well, I was looking out, when,
about two o’clock, the Governor’s Coach drew up. His gouty legs were done up
in red Flannel &#38; his lackeys carried him in, to see the President. Later the President
went and drank tea with him and Mrs Hancock. I wouldn’t have returned
such a call. My father was very much pleased. He said that settled one thing
forever, that the National Government was supreme, and the States must take
second place.</p>

<p class='c021'>Wednesday night was the Assembly. I had a lovely pink Silk Gown, made
new for the great occasion, &#38; I wore as all the young ladies did, a broad white
Satin sash, with G. W. in gold letters, with a laurel Wreath around them. On one
end of the sash was painted an American Eagle, &#38; on the other a Fleur-de-lis. I
saw yr honored Mother, and she was very gracious to me. She looked very Handsome
&#38; Stately, in a beautiful Velvit gown, and the sash like ours, only black with
gold letters and Devices.</p>

<p class='c021'>I had the honor of a Dance with his Excellency, and he was pleased to be most
charming in his Manner. He complimented my appearance, and said that he had
found our New England ladies quite as Handsome as those in the South. I felt
more complimented when he talked with me about public Affairs here, &#38; I know
that I blushed when he praised my knowledge of Politics. I admired yr description
of him, &#38; I know it is true. I could feel his nobility and greatness of Soul. Oh,
Jack, how can anyone say such horrid things of him, when he is so Pure, so High
minded, when he is the Saviour of our Country. When he stood there on the
balcony of the State-house, with everybody cheering and shouting, I could not help
thinking of him as he was at Valley Forge, cold &#38; hungry, sacrificing everything
for his soldiers, and the tears of gratitude &#38; affection came into my eyes. Well,
he is gone, and I pray he may return safely Home. I suppose he will not go
through Springfield on his way back. I asked him about Springfield, and he said it
was no great Town, but Lovely in situation, and that Zenas Parson’s Tavern was
a good one. I think—I am not sure—but perhaps, under certain circumstances,
a city girl might be happy in the country. But this letter is too long. I meant to
punish you by making it short. You need not expect another for at least a Month.
This is to be a very gay winter, &#38; I doubt not, I shall be much sought after, so I
shall have small time to write to my friends in the Country.</p>

<p class='c015'>The careful historical student may find some anachronisms in these
letters, yet in the main they give a true account of the time “when Washington
came to Springfield,” and rode, with his coach and four along the
New England highways, in the bright autumn weather.</p>

</div>

<p class='c024'><span class='small'>[We are indebted to Mr. Herbert W. Kimball, of Boston, Registrar of the Massachusetts
S. A. R., for the two accounts of the “shot heard round the world.” The first was prepared
for the Boston News-Letter, in 1826, and the second, although written many years ago,
was not printed until 1896, and then only in a newspaper, hence will probably be as new
to most of our readers as it is to the Editor. The bill of Dr. Fisk has never been published
or printed in any form, and is especially interesting as showing, what we believe has not
been stated by any writer, that several of the British wounded who were left behind, were
cared for by the patriots. The detailed list of the killed and wounded of the patriots was
also prepared especially for the S. A. R., and published in their Register, a few years
ago.—ED.]</span></p>
<h3 class='c013'>I</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Between the hours of 12 and 1, on the 19th April, 1775, news
was received at Lexington by express from the Hon. Joseph
Warren, at Boston, that a large body of King’s troops, supposed
to be about 1200 or 1500 were embarked in boats from Boston, and
gone over to land on Lechmere Point (now East Cambridge) probably
to seize the military stores at Concord.</p>

<p class='c015'>On receipt of this intelligence, signal guns were fired, the bell rung,
and the militia of the town were ordered to meet at the usual place of
parade. About the same time two persons were sent express to Cambridge
to gain intelligence and watch the route of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Lexington train band, or militia, and the alarm men, consisting
of the aged and others exempted from military duty, except in case of
alarm, met according to order, on the commons near the meetinghouse,
and waited the return of the messengers. There were present when the
roll was called about 120 militia and alarm men together. Between
three and four A. M., one of the messengers returned, saying there was
no appearance of troops neither on the Cambridge or the Charlestown
roads. Put off their guard by this information, and the night being
chilly and uncomfortable on the parade ground, the privates were dismissed,
to appear again at the beat of drum. Some, who resided in the
neighborhood, went to their homes, others to the public house at the east
corner of the common. Messrs. Hancock and Adams had been persuaded
to depart from the town, as the seizure of their persons was
probably one object of the enemy. The return of the second messenger
was anxiously awaited by the officers who had continued at their posts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>but he had been taken prisoner by the enemy, as every other person had
been who passed up or down the road; so that, after every precaution,
the British troops were actually in the town, and upon a quick march
towards the place of parade, within half an hour after the company was
dismissed. The commanding officer, however, thought it proper to
muster them in the very face of the enemy; alarm guns were accordingly
fired and the drum beat to arms about 4:30 o’clock. Part of the company,
to the number of about sixty, were soon on the parade; others were
hastening towards it, when the attack was made. The Lexington company,
as they hastily formed on the rising ground to the north of the
meetinghouse, were placed in two ranks, ordered to load with ball, and
as previously agreed, were determined to offer no aggression, but to repel
it if offered by the British.</p>

<p class='c015'>The British van, commanded by Major Pitcairn, had thus stolen
upon the militia unawares, while temporarily dismissed, and it was in
sight of the formidable body that the little band of Americans was forming
their ranks when the enemy halted at about twelve rods distance.
Major Pitcairn with his aids, hastily rode up the Bedford road to right
of the meetinghouse, and returned by the Concord road to the left; and
having thus reconnoitered this handful of men, drew his pistol and cried:
“Disperse, Rebels; throw down your arms and disperse,” gave orders to
fire, and fired his own pistol. The soldiers at the same time ran up
huzzaing, and fired, at first some scattering guns, which were immediately
followed by a general discharge, which did no injury, excepting slightly
wounding one man; and the fire was not returned; but the second discharge
was fatal to several Americans. They returned the fire, as far as
the confusion in their ranks from the number of killed or wounded would
permit. The militia dispersed immediately after firing, but were shot
at as they retreated. The British troops then resumed their march to
Concord.</p>

<p class='c016'>This story of the Concord fight is taken from the original manuscript
of Thaddeus Blood, of Concord, and was first published in the
Boston Journal in 1896. He began as a minuteman, and later was a
Lieutenant in Captain Moses Barnes’ company, Lieut.-Col. Pierce’s
regiment, stationed part of the time in Rhode Island and part in Swanzey,
as his own quaint phraseology puts its. He says:</p>

<p class='c017'>On the morning of the 19th of April, 1775, about 2 o’clock in
the morning, I was called out of bed by John Barrett, a Sergeant of
the militia company to which I belonged (I was 20 years of age the
28th of May next following): I joined the company under Captain
Nathan Barrett (afterwards Colonel), at the old court-house, about
3 o’clock, and was ordered to go to the Court House to draw
ammunition. After the company had all drawn their ammunition
we were paraded near the meetinghouse and I should suppose that
there was 60 or 70 men in Capt. Barrett’s company, and that the
whole of the militia and minute-men of Concord under arms that day
was not less than 200. About 4 o’clock they were joined by two companies
from Lincoln: the militia commanded by Capt. Pierce
(afterwards Colonel) and the minute-men by Capt. William Smith—the
venerable and honorable Samuel Hoar of Lincoln was one
of his lieutenants—and were then formed, the minute-men on the
right and Capt. Barrett’s on the left, and marched in order to the
end of Meriam’s Hill, then so-called, and saw the British troops
a-coming down Brooks’ Hill: the sun was arising and shined on their
red coats and glis’ning arms. We retreated in order over the top
of the hill to the Liberty pole erected on the heights opposite the
meetinghouse, and made a halt; the main body of the British
marched up in the road and a detachment followed us over the hill,
and halted in half gun-shot of us, at the pole; we then marched over
the burying-ground to the road and then over the bridge to Hunt’s
Hill, or Punkataisett so called at that time, and were followed by
two companies of the British. One company went up to destroy
stores at Colonel James Barrett’s, and they tarried near the bridge;
some of them went to Capt. David Brown’s, some to Mr Ephraim
Butterick’s. About 9 o’clock we saw smoke rise at the Court
House; it was proposed to march into town and were joined by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Westford and Acton companies, and were drawn up west of where
Colonel Jonas Butterick now lives. Colonel James Barrett rode
along the line, and having consulted with the officers, shouted, not
to fire first; then began their march—Robinson and Butterick led.
Upon beginning to march the company of British formed first on the
causeway in platoons: they then retreated over the bridge and took
up three planks and formed, part in the road and part on each side;
our men the same time marching in very good order along the road
in double file. At that time an officer rode up, and a gun was fired.
I saw where the ball threw up the water about the middle of the
river; then a second and a third shot, and cry of fire, fire, was made
from front to rear: the fire was almost simultaneous with the cry,
and I think it was not more than two minutes, if so much, till the
British run, and the fire ceased. Part of our men went over the
bridge and myself among the rest, and part returned to the ground
they had left. After the firing, every one appeared to be his own
commander; it was thought best to go the east part of the town and
take them as they came back. Each took his own station; for myself,
I took my stand south of where Dr Minot then lived; when I
saw the British coming from Concord, their right flank in the
meadows, their left on the hill.</p>

<p class='c017'>“When near the foot of the hill Col. Thompson of Billerica
came up, with three or four hundred men, and there was heavy firing,
but the distance so great that little injury was done on either
side; at least I saw but one killed, and a number wounded.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The rest of the story is more familiar to us—the steady, running
fight, all the way, until Lord Percy’s welcome reinforcement saved the
day—and the exhausted British detachment reached once more the
sheltering lines of Boston, whence they had set out with so much confidence
that early morning. Of the patriots, 49 were killed, 39 wounded
and 5 missing. Of the British, 73 were killed, 174 wounded and 26
missing.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE MEMORIAL TREES AT WASHINGTON</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>How to identify memorial trees has become an interesting question
with the Washington authorities who have charge of the public
grounds. While this city has no elm under which Washington
took command of the army, and no oak that saved the charter of
colonial liberties, it has not a few trees about which exceedingly interesting
history gathers.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Russo-American oak, planted a year ago, by President Roosevelt,
assisted by Secretary Hitchcock, in the lawn near the west terrace of
the White House, has a novel history. It is a lineal descendant of a
native American oak, which overshadowed the old tomb of Washington
at Mount Vernon. Acorns from this oak were sent by Charles Sumner,
while a Senator, to the Czar of Russia. Secretary Hitchcock thus tells
the rest of the story:</p>

<p class='c015'>“While ambassador at the court of St. Petersburg I made inquiry
with respect to the acorns that Charles Sumner, while Senator from
Massachusetts, sent to the Czar, and I found that they had been planted
on what is known as ‘Czarina Island,’ which is included in the superb surroundings
of one of the palaces of his Majesty, near Peterhof, and there
I found a beautiful oak with a tablet at its foot bearing a Russian inscription
which reads: ‘The acorn planted here was taken from an oak which
shades the tomb of the celebrated and never-to-be-forgotten Washington;
is presented to his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, as
a sign of the greatest respect.—By an American.’</p>

<p class='c015'>“I was fortunate at the time of my visit, which was in the fall of
1898, in finding a number of acorns on the ground. Gathering a handful
I sent them home, and secured from the seed thus planted a few oak saplings,
one of which I planted, with the permission of President Roosevelt,
in the grounds of the White House, while another I planted near its
grandparent, which is still in existence at Mount Vernon. Both of these
young trees, I hope, will reach such age and strength as will, for years to
come typify the continued friendship of the Governments and people of
the United States and Russia.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A superb specimen of the Oriental plane tree (<em>Platanus orientalis</em>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>originally planted in 1862, in the United States Botanic Garden by direction
of Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, now forms one of the chief
attractions of Lincoln Park. Having suffered from an overflow of the
Potomac in 1870, which threatened its destruction, it was removed from
the Botanic Garden to Lincoln Park, then an unimproved Government
reservation. In 1872, when this park was improved with walks and
ornamental plantings, a part of the plan of improvement adopted was the
construction of an oval mound in the center, intended to form the site of
a colossal statue of Abraham Lincoln, if an appropriation could be
secured for that purpose. This tree was bare-stemmed, with a few small
branches near the top, about eight feet from the original ground surface.
The mound was made around it, and from this bare stem, which subsequently
was covered with earth, it speedily sent out roots, and began a
growth of phenomenal rapidity, which has continued till it is now over
seventy feet in height, with a nearly equal spread of branches.</p>

<p class='c015'>Trees as well as statuary may serve as monuments. In the parks
and gardens of the cities of Europe there are many such trees. In Washington,
the official home of our Presidents, and the temporary abiding
place of so many distinguished statesmen and men of letters, exceptional
opportunities have been afforded, and there are many trees notable for the
historic interest attached to them.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the grounds around the White House stands a stately American
elm said to have been planted by President John Quincy Adams. It forms
a conspicuous object, towering above the surrounding plantings on the
mound to the southeast of the White House. An American elm was
planted by President Hayes in March, 1878, near the west entrance of
the north roadway approach to the White House. A sweet-gum tree was
planted by President Harrison, in April, 1892, in the lawn northeast of
the White House. A scarlet oak was planted by President McKinley,
March, 1898, in the lawn west of the White House, bordering the walk
now leading to the executive offices.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Cameron elm, one of the old trees in the Capitol grounds, south
of the south wing of the building, is made notable from the circumstance
that Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania, while a member of the Senate
Committee on Public Buildings, intervened in its behalf and prevented its
destruction.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the Botanic Garden are planted a large number of trees, memorials
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>of men prominent in the Nation’s history. These trees are both evergreen
and deciduous, and a number of them are splendid specimens. There is
the Crittenden tree, an overcup oak, planted in 1863 by J. J. Crittenden,
of Crittenden compromise fame. The acorns for this and a companion
tree planted at the same time by Robert Mallory, a personal friend of
Crittenden, were brought from Kentucky by them. Mr. Mallory’s tree
was planted on what was, prior to its incorporation in the Botanic Garden,
the towpath of the old Washington Canal.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Garfield tree has this novel history: At the funeral ceremonies
of President Garfield a small seedling branchlet of acacia was placed on
his coffin by a member of the Masonic fraternity. After his burial this
seedling plant was brought to Washington, and planted in its present location.
Near this tree, on the opposite side of the walk, an acacia tree has
been planted as a memorial to Albert Pike, for so many years the central
figure of the Masonic fraternity in the United States. The Hoar and
Evarts memorial trees are two handsome specimens of the cedar of
Lebanon, planted by Senators Hoar and Evarts, close together. The
Holman tree is a superb Crimean fir, planted about thirty-eight years ago
by the Indiana economist, who is now almost forgotten. There are two
Wahoo, or winged elm trees, planted by Lot M. Morrill and Justin S.
Morrill during their terms of service in the United States Senate. These
somewhat rare trees are now handsome specimens of the garden.</p>

<p class='c015'>A Chinese oak with a novel history grows near by; many years ago
a friend of Charles A. Dana, travelling in China, picked up a number of
acorns under a tree growing by the grave of Confucius, and brought them
to America for Mr. Dana, who planted them in his grounds. This tree
was grown from one of these acorns.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are also a number of other memorial trees planted in these
grounds; among the most notable are a British oak commemorating the
settlement of the Alabama claims, and two American elms, seedlings
from the Washington elm growing at Cambridge. And there are many
more.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c013'>LETTER FROM BENJAMIN HAWKINS TO GOVERNOR CASWELL</h3>

<p class='c016'><span class='small'>[Benjamin Hawkins was a member of the Continental Congress, and interpreter for Washington
with the French officers. (Washington is said to have greatly regretted the necessity for
an interpreter, as it failed to bring the French officers in proper touch with the commander.)
The letter is dated at “Bath” presumably in North Carolina, as the writer refers to
“this state.” It is addressed to Richard Caswell, the Governor of North Carolina. The
writer was born in N. C. in 1754, and died in Georgia, 1816. A Princeton graduate, and
proficient in modern languages, his knowledge of French made him very useful to Washington.
In 1780 he was commissioned to buy arms abroad. These he shipped in a vessel belonging to
John Stanly a merchant of New Berne. After the Revolution he became one of the Senators
from N. C. In 1797 he was Indian Superintendent, over all the tribes south of the Ohio, and
held this office through several administrations. Although rich he left home to establish
a settlement and manufactory in the Creek Nation, near what is now Hawkinsville, Ga.
(named in his honor).]</span></p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>DEAR SIR,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>I have the pleasure of informing your excellency of my arrival here
with some muskets for this State; I ship’d eight hundred and seventy-eight
stand from St. Eustatius, I shall land five hundred stand at Washington—the
remainder which come in another bottom, will be at Edenton.</p>

<p class='c015'>I could not procure anything on the faith of the State, or by barter
for provisions or tobacco as was expected, they were taught to believe
in the West Indies that a bushel of salt would purchase one hundred
weight of tobacco, and that two and one-half, a barrel of pork. While
they entertain this idea (salt being of little value there) it will be
impossible to barter for more valuable articles, the exchange to be in
this State, as was suggested by some gentlemen in the assembly. The
price of tobacco had fallen in the West Indies about the time of my arrival
there, owing to the quantity just then imported from the continent—which
with the advise of Mr. Governeur, the continental agent there
determined me to reship the tobacco in Dutch bottoms to Europe, he
undertook to do it, and advanced for six hundred of the arms—the
remainder I purchased on my own credit on Interest for the State—the
arms are very good and purchased at the reasonable price of five and
five and a half pieces of eight per stand. Part of the tobacco I ship’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>was damaged, which can only be accounted for either by the negligence
of the inspector or the bad state of the warehouse where it was stored.</p>

<p class='c015'>We were apprised of the sailing of the fleet from New York, which
made me assiduous in geting all the arms I could in St. Eustatia as I well
knew our situation. A large supply of arms and cloathing may be had
by this from the West Indies provided we can make remittances—three
thousand stand I am offered and one thousand suits of cloathing.</p>

<p class='c015'>Should the present plan of importing necessaries still continue to be
countenanced by the general assembly, I shall prepair to remit as much
as possible, tho’ I doubt vessels cannot be procured—freighting at the
present extravigant prices will not be so advantageous as purchasing.
If the latter be practicable, I must draw on you for money—I will send
you the price currant of articles for the West India market by the next
opportunity.</p>

<p class='c015'>A Continental brigantine was cut out from Saby by some British
privateers tho’ opposed by the fire from the fort, she has been since
demand(ed?) but refused—it was suggested that the Captain, —— Ashmead,
and some of his men went into the fort and assisted in protecting
their vessel, the answer of the governor of St. Kitts to the demand is
humourous; he congratulated the governor of Saby<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c023'><sup>[25]</sup></a> on the restoration of
the island seized by the rebel Americans.</p>

<p class='c015'>Part of the French fleet have arrived at Martinique, but we had no
account of the Count, some supposed he had sailed for Europe others to
South America.</p>

<p class='c015'>We had various reports from Europe which as I recollect I send
you—the Dutch have been repeatedly solicited to take part with Britain,
they evade it as much as possible, it is said they have given as a reason
that they did not think the present plans &#38; intention of the British ministry
to be to the interest either of Britain or her allies, but manifestly to
their ruin and discredit, and therefore although they were and are at all
times ready to act for the interest of great Britain, yet for the reasons
before named they must now declare themselves neuter and protest
against the proceedings of —— This is credited by some in St. Eustatia.
They further report that the dutch Embassador has ben recalled
from the British Court in consideration of a demand of some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>vessels carried into the Texel by John Paul Jones; the governor of St.
Eustatius imagines that the Dutch will take part with Britain.</p>

<p class='c015'>The grand convention will be held at Versailles in April—the King
of Prussia &#38; Empress of Russia have promised their mediation, the
British fleet are in Torbay and do not expect to put to sea till April. John
Paul Jones who sailed from Brest in a fifty gun ship with some frigates
went north about and did infinite damage to the British vessels—he fell
in with the convoy from Norway and took the Seraphis, a new fifty gun
ship, and the Countess of Scarborough of 20—Jones engaged the
Seraphis two hours, and the whole time they were so near that the guns
touched the opposite vessel. Jones lost one hundred and Eighty two
men, and Pearson 189. Jones’ ship sunk the next day and he went with
his prizes into the Texel, there to refit them. Sir Joseph York demanded
them, which was so strenuously opposed by the French minister that his
demand was refused and repeatedly. Jones was received with every
imaginable mark of respect by the Dutch.</p>

<p class='c015'>I expect the pleasure of seeing your excellency within a few days—excuse
the imperfection of my letter—I am with due respect—</p>

movement was not to be far away, as
only two days’ provisions were called
for. There was something to be performed
in the secrecy of the night. Col.
Butler was probably Col. Richard Butler,
who was a capable officer of the
9th Pennsylvania. Major Hull was
later Gen. Hull, of the War of 1812.
Sackett had his home in the neighborhood
near where Wayne was writing,
and had been very active in civil life. He
graduated at Yale, and was prominent
in revolutionary committees. He
brought to Fishkill the news of the
Battle of Lexington, organized local
patriotic meetings, and was associated
with the leaders in that historic time. It
seems that Wayne looked to him to give
him some important aid where nothing
was accomplished, because of some new
turn for other action. Such are familiar
to the soldier. Many soldiers were
quartered in Fishkill, where those officers
and men to be called must have
been.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>THE LAST VETERAN GONE</h3>

<p class='c016'>Hiram Cronk, the last survivor of
the War of 1812, died at the age of
105, at his home in Oneida County,
N. Y., May 15, and was given a public
military funeral in New York City,
May 18—the Society of the War of
1812 forming a part of the escort. The
body lay in state over night at the City
Hall—an honor never before shown to
a private soldier—and on May 19 was
interred in Cypress Hills Cemetery,
Long Island.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>g.</em> MCPIKE—Have the ship registers
been preserved, of arrivals of emigrants
at port of Baltimore, Maryland, <em>circa</em>
1772, from Dublin, Ireland, and London,
England? My ancestor, James
McPike, of Scotch parentage, is said to
have migrated from Dublin to Baltimore
in 1772. His son, John McPike, was
born at Wheeling, W. Va., 4th or 5th

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
